# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Water and solutions
## Water
- `Polar molecule`
    - $\delta-\rArr$ `negative` charge towards `oxygen`
    - $\delta+\rArr$ `positive` charge towards `hydrogen`
- Covers ~70% of earth's surface
- Life originated in the ocean
- ~70% of tissues consist of water
- Water molecules' electrons form weak `hydrogen bonds` with each other
- Molecules which form hydrogen bonds with water easily are called `hydrophilic`
### `Unusual properties`
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">1.Highest density at 4°C
- Ice floats on top of water
  - New habitat is created
  - The ice on the surface insulates the water below
  - This allows aquatic animals to survive winters below ice
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">2. High heat capacity
- A lot of energy is required to break the hydrogen bonds of water
- Because of this, oceans & large bodies of water can act as a `temperature buffer`
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">3. high boiling point
- ~100°C @ 1 atm
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">4. Water is cohesive
- Water molecules are kept together at the liquid-air interface -->
- Highest surface tension of any known liquid (72.8 mN/m)
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">5. Water is adhesive
- Water attaches to other polar molecules
- this enables the `capillary effect`

### <span style="color:#fabd2f">6. It acts in chemical reactions
- In photosynthesis:
6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>0 = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub>
- As a product of breathing:
 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> = 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>0
- `Condensation:` when 2 molecules are linked with the removal of H<sub>2</sub>O
- `Hydrolysis:` The process of breaking apart of a molecule by the addition of water (opposite of condensation)
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">7. High solvent power
- Water is a very good solvent, also referred to as a universal solvent
- This helps biological reactions take place

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Processes in solutions
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">1. Diffusion
- Particles will move from a place of higher concentration to a place of lower concentration
- No energy is needed for this
- I.e: Solute moving towards solvent

### <span style="color:#fabd2f">2. Osmosis
- In osmosis, water diffuses to an area of low water concentration through a semi-permeable membrane
- I.e: Solvent moving towards solute
- Important for plant cells:
  - If plant cell is filled with water, it becomes turgid
  - If plant cell is filled with a concentrated solution, it becomes flaccid
  - If plant cell is filled with a highly concentrated solution, it undergoes plasmolysis
