- Animals don't store it, as it's heavy
- 1g glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) --> 17 kJ energy


- Groups:
  - Monosaccharides
  - Disaccharides
  - Polysaccharides 


## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Monosaccharides
- Sweet-tasting
- Water-soluble
1. Triose sugars
2. Tetrose
### `Pentose sugars:`
- Components of nucleic acids & nucleotides
- ![](Deoxyribose_vs_Ribose_sugar.jpg)
### `Hexose sugars:`
    - Monomers of di- and polysaccharides
    - Glucose belongs here
    - Most important fuel for cell metabolism
