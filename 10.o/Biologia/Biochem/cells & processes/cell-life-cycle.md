# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Life cycle of cells
1. Growth --> ~10 hrs | G1
2. DNA synthesis --> ~8 hrs | S
3. Growth & preparation for mitosis --> ~4 hrs | G2
4. Mitosis --> ~1-2 hrs | M
#
- G1, S, G2 are called `interphase period`[^1]
[^1]: During this period, the DNA is `uncoiled, loose and messy`
## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Three principles of cell theory
- All living organisms are composed of one or more cells
- Cells are the basic units of structure and organization in organisms
- Cells form from pre-existing cells

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Organisation of DNA
- During cell division DNA is tightly wound and organized into [chromosomes](#chromosomes)

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Mitosis
- Produces two new (body) cells
- Child cells are identical to parent cells (ideally)
- 4 step process:
  - [Prophase](#prophase)
  - [Metaphase](#metaphase)

### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Prophase
- First step of mitosis
- Chromosomes need to be moved, but they're surrounded by the nuclear envelope
- The nuclear envelope is broken down
- Nucleolus disappears
- `Mitotic spindle` begins to form
  - Centorsomes divide into two
  - Move to opposite poles of the cell
  - They form a fan-like sturcture of fibers
  - They 'grab' chromosomes in the centromere

### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Metaphase
- The spindle has lined up chromosomes in the middle of the cell
- One centromere is attached to the two different poles by two fibers
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Anaphase
- Sister chromatids are separated by the fibers and pulled to opposite poles of the cell
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Telophase
- Cell begins to reestablish normal structures:
  - Nuclear membrane surrounds chromatids again
  - Nucleolus reappears
- Cytokinesis:
  - The cytoplasm is split into two to form the daughter cells


## Chromosomes
- Two arms contain one copy of the DNA each
