# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Protein synthesis

- DNA --> In the nucleus
- Ribosome --> In the cytoplasm
- The DNA cannot leave the nucleus --> it cannot be transported to the ribosome for protein synthesis




### Process of protein synthesis:
- transcription
- translation


## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Characteristics of genetic code
- Made up of `triplets`
- `Unambiguous` --> Each codon codes for just one amino acid
- `Redundant` --> there are amino acids which are encoded by `more than one codon`
- Reading frame --> How letters are divided into codons
  - Codons are read by groups of three (no overlapping)
- No gaps or commas
- `Universal` --> All living organisms have to same genetic code
  - Important because one organism can read the genetic code of another to produce its proteins


## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Ribosome
- Located in the cytoplasm
- 2 subunits (larger, smaller)
- Translation happens here
- Responsible for synthesising proteins from DNA
- Process:
  1. first tRNA arrives, transfers the first amino acid
  2. second tRNA brings second amino acid --> peptide bond is formed between the two
  3. If thirs amino acid arrives, detach the first tRNA
  4. Repeat 1-3 for as long as needed
