# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Lipids

## General features
- Non-polar molecules
- Groups:
  - Natural fats & oils
  - Phospholipids
  - Steroids
  - Carotenoids

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Natural fats & oils
- They are aesthers[^1] of fatty acids with glycerol[^2]
[^2]:![](glycerol.png)
- When glycerol reacts with a fatty acid, condensation happens to create a neutral fat
- Fatty acids have long hydrocarbon chains (Marked with `R`)
- Hydrophobic, non-polar molecules
- If a fatty acids contains a CH<sub>3</sub> group, it is a `saturated fatty acid`
- If a fatty acids contains a CH==CH group, it is an `unsaturated fatty acid`
### Fats
- Usually solid @ room temp
- Usually contain more `saturated fatty acids`
- More stable than oils
### Oils
- Usually liquid @ room temp
- Usually contain more `unsaturated fatty acids`
- Easily become `rancid`
### Unsaturated fatty acids
- also called Vitamin F
- Essential for humans

### Importance
- Food storage
- heat insulation
- Mechanical protection
- Waterproofing of skin
- Solvents for some vitamins
- Essential

## Healthcare aspects
- Lipids provide twice the energy of carbohydrates/proteins
- Minimum energy required in 1 day: 2400 kJ

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Phospholipids
- Instead of a third fatty acid chain, they have a phosphate group
- Half polar, half apolar
- Creates a bilayer to form the cell membrane

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Steroids
- Chemicals with a sterane base
### Bile salts
- emulsifier
- makes fat into small droplets --> easier digestion

### Vitamin D
- fat-soluble
- Important for proper formation of bones
- Boosts immune system performance
- Its lack causes `rachitis / rickets`[^1]
- UV in sunlight promotes production of Vitamin D in the skin

### Coricostreoids
- Lowers immune system function
- Important for metabolisis
- e.g cortisol

### Cholesterol
- Strengthens cell membrane
- High cholesterol is correlated with CHD
- Hydrophobic
    -in The blood it is transported by HDL[^2], LDL[^3]
[^2]: High-Density Lipoprotein: Delivers cholesterol from the artieries to the liver (--> 'good' cholesterol)
[^3]: Low-Density Lipoprotein: Delivers cholesterol from the liver to the arteries

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Carotenoids
- Their name comes from 'carrot'
- They are plant pigments creating a bright red/yellow/orange color
- They absorb light, help chlorophyll
- Important for animals & humans
- Lack of coretnoids causes night blindness
- Protects DNA from 'free radicals'
- Antioxidant function
- Conjugated double bonds: Causes their vibrant color
- Some carotenoids:
    - Carotene : orange
    - Licopene : bright red (found in tomatoes)
    - Xanthophyll : yellow (in fallen leaves)
    - Vitamin K
    - Vitamin E
