- `Food:`
  - nutrients --> Proteins, fats, carbohydrates
  - minerals
  - vitamins
  - water
  - roughage
    - Provides nutrition for symbiotic bacteria
    - Helps food keep moving through the GI tract



## Steps of nutrition
- Ingestion --> `Physical breakdown` of food
- Digestion --> `Chemical breakdown `of food (via `enzymes & hydrolysis`)
- Absorption --> Nutrient monomers enter the `circulatory/lymphatic system`
- Assimilation --> `Macromolecules are synthesized` from nutrients
- Egestion --> Undigested `waste is removed`
