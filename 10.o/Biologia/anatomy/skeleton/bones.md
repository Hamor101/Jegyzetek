# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Bones

- Functions of the skeletal system:
  - `Structural support`
  - Surface for `muscles to attach`
  - Production of `blood cells` (red marrow)
  - `Energy storage` (yellow marrow)
  - `Protection` of vital organs
  - Mineral storage

- Divided into `two parts:`
  - Appendicular
  - Axial
    - Skull
    - Rib cage + vertbral column

## Inside structure
- Cancellous/spongy bone:
  - 'sponge-like'
  - Has cavities
  - Cavities are filled by `marrow`
  - Marrow produces (all) blood cells
- Compact bone:
  - 


## Types of bones
- Short:
  - Compact bone around the surface
  - Cancellous bone in the center
  - E.g --> Wrist bones
- Flat:
  - Variable amount of cancellous bone enclosed by two thin layers of compact bone
- Long:
  - Epiphysis --> 'head' at both endsa, covered with `cartilage`
  - Diaphysis --> long 'shaft' of the bone, covered with `periosteum`[^1]
  - `Central cavity` filled with `yellow bone marrow` --> `fat storage`
  - `Compact bone` around central cavity
  - `Cancellous bone` around the heads

## Bone tissue
- Made up of `cell & extracellular matrix`
- 35% organic
- 65% inorganic
- Extracellular matrix is `filled with minerals` (mainly calcium & mg)
- Collagen fibres --> Provide some amount of flexibility

## Skeletal differences by sex
### Female
- weaker, more delicate bones
- wider pelvis for childbirth

### Male
- generally bigger, stronger
- wider shoulders
- different pelvic angle




# Joins

## Joint structure
- Cartilage --> Protects the end of bones
- Synovial fluid --> Fluid within the joint used for lubrication
- Fluid needs to be kept between the bones --> `Bursa / Synovial capsule`
- Ligaments --> Hold the bones in place

## Joint types
- Categorized by degrees of freedom
- Fingers: 1 axis
- Palm:  2 axes
- Shoulder & thigh: 3 axes
