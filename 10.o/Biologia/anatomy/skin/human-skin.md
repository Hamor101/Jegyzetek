# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Human skin

- Largest organ
## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Functions:
  - Protection:
    - Mechanical
    - Chemical
    - Biological (keeps out pathogens)
    - Radiation (protection from UV)
  - Sensing:
    - Touch
    - Pressure
    - Temperature
    - Pain
  - Thermoregulation
    - Traps air between hairs (goosebumps)
    - Allows sweat to evaporate
    - Changes capillary diameter based on temperature
  - `Excretion` (via sweat)
  - `Breastfeeding` (via modified sweat glands)
  - Production of `Vitamin D`
  - Fat storage

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Layers
- Epidermis
- Dermis
- Subcutaneous layer / Hypodermis

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Epidermis
- No blood vessels --> Outside cells die
- Multi-layered keratinized squamous epithelium
- Dead cells are `pushed outward` by underlying cells
- Lower part contains `melanocytes`

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Dermis
- Connective tissue
- Contains:
  - Nerve endings --> Provides sense
  - Subaceous (oil) glands --> Waterproofs skin
  - Sweat glands (+ milk glands) --> Thermoregulation
  - Capillaries
  - Hair follicles

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Hypodermis
- Made up of `adipose tissue`
- Functions:
  - Heat isolation
  - Protection from physical damage
  - long-term energy storage


## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Skin problems
- Birhtmarks:
  - Overgrowth of blood vessels / melanocytes
- Warts:
  - Caused by viruses
- Water / blood blisters
  - Small pockets filled with liquid
  - Should NOT be broken
- Rash
  - Can be caused by pathogens, allergies, cosmetics
- Hives
  - Special rashes
- Acne
  - Cause: Overproduction of oil + too many dead cells around a hair follicle
- Pimple:
  - Infected hair follicle --> inflamation
