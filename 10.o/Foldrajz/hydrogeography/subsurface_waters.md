`Infiltration` : The process by which water sinks into the soil\
- 3 types:
    - `Soil moisture`
    - `Groundwater`
    - `Layerwater`

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Soil moisture
- Different types of soil can store different amounts of water
- Amount of water the soil can store depends on its `water retention capacity`[^1]
- Water retention depends on `particle size`:
    - Small particle size --> Better ✅
    - Large particle size --> Worse ❌
- Ideal soil has `medium particle size` (e.g Chernozem)
- This type of subsurface water can evaporate:
    - It `forms quickly`, and `evaporates quickly`
### Mechanism of water retention
- Water molecules form a thin film-layer around soil particles
- In this state:
    - It's easier for plants to absorb water
    - Some air is left between particles (good for organisms' respiration)


[^1]: What portion of the infiltrated water can be held by a given type of soil

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Groundwater
- Gaps between particles in the layer above the impermeable layer are `completely filled with water`
    - Bad for plants
- Depth of the groundwater table[^2] depends on multiple factors
- It is possible for so much groundwater to build up that it reaches the surface (this causes plants to `rot`, because roots need to respire)[^3]
- Water from this layer is sometimes given to animals, but `never humans`, as it's easily polluted
### Mechanism
- If higher layers of soil have bad water retention, water begins to move deeper
- Water moves down until it reaches an impermeable layer
- Water begins to accumulate above this layer, making `groundwater`

[^3]: No word exists for this in English, in Hungarian, it is called `Belvíz`


## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Layerwater
- Layers which retain water are called `aquifers` (this is usually a porous rock, like sandstone)
- Layerwater is water which is accumulated `between to impermeable layers`
- Umbrella term
- Waters which belong here:
    - Mineral waters
    - Thermal waters
    - Karst waters
    - Artesian waters
### Mineral
- Layerwater which has high mineral content (in excess of 500mg/L)
### Thermal
- Layerwater, which, when coming to the surface, exceeeds the Annual Mean Temperature of the area where it springs
- In Hungary, thermal water must excees 20°C
### Karst
- Layerwater which collects in and springs out of limtestone mountains
### Mechanism
- 2 mechanisms:
    - Impermeable layers `aren't completely impermeable`
     OR\
    - Water gets between the impermeable layer `from the side`
