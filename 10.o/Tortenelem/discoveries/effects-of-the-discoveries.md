# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Effects of the Discoveries

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">On natives
- Huge drop in population
  - `Genocide`
  - European `diseases`
- Survivors --> `Enslaved`, wealth expoited
- New technologies (brought by the Europeans)
- Forcefully christianized
- Their `language was erased` (had to learn Spanish & Portugese)

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">On Europeans
- New wealth acquired
  - New supplies of `Gold & Silver`
  - `Land`
- New crops & livestock
  - Most influential: `Potato`
  - New source of fodder for animals: `Corn`

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Influx of Gold & Silver
- Large supply of newly minted `coins` --> `inflation`
- More people --> More `demand`
- Demand > Supply --> `Rising prices`
- Most inflated products:
  - `foodstuffs` --> Mostly produced in `Eastern Europe`
  - `industrial products` (less inflated than the former) --> Mostly produced in `Western Europe`

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Drop in profits of Western European countries
- Up to this point, `guilds` produced products
- Need for higher production rate <--> Guilds
  - Guilds were `heavily regulated` --> Limited production
#
### `Solution:` Putting-out system
- `raw materials` were brought to villages from the countryside by `entrepeneurs`
- `Villagers` produced required goods
- Goods were `sold elsewhere`
#
- The putting-out system:
  - Decreased guilds' business
  - Lead to `guild bakruptcies`


## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Manufactories
- To solve the inefficiency of having to hire villagers far from the towns:
  - Brought `villagers to towns`
  - Started paying them `wages`
- Thus, manufactories were established
- Work was divided into `phases` -->` Mass-production` emerged --> `Cheaper goods` for customers
