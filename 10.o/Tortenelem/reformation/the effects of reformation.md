# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Effects of the reformation
- Everyone was supposed to read the bible --> Wider spread of `literacy / education`
- `Printing houses` established (mainly to print religious writings)
- Christianity was split into different denominations --> [Religious wars](religious-wars.md)
- 3 main denominations at the time in europe
  - Catholic
  - Lutheran --> Evangélikus
  - Calvinist --> Református
  - Anabaptist --> Baptista
- Unlike the catholic church, reformed churches didn't prohibit `interest`
  - Strengthened the `middle class`
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Anabaptists
- Believed babies shouldn't be baptised
- Political influence of the catholic church decreased
- Lutherans & calvinists believed the `church shouldn't be involved in politics`
## Reaction of the Roman Catholic church
