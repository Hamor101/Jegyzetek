# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Interactions between populations
- Populations of different species have direct/indirect interactions
- Grouped by `effect on partners`:
  - With `benefit` (win-win) +
  - With `disadvantage` -
  - With `neutral` effect 0
- Interaction types:
  - [Symbiosis](#symbiosis-)
  - [Commensalism](#commensalism-0)
  - [Antibiosis](#antibiosis---)
  - [Predation](#predation--)
  - [Parasitism](#parasitism---)
  - [Competition](#competition----)


### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Symbiosis (+,+)
- Mutually beneficial
- Symbiont partners `can not survive without each other`
- Examples:
  - `Lichens:` Fungi live with algae/cyanobacteria, fungi give protection, absorb water, minerals, CO<sub>2</sub>, Algae photosynthesize
  - `Micorrhiza:` Fungi live onthe roots of vascular plants, fungi increase water and mineral uptake, plant provides organic compounds 
  - `cellulose decomposing bacteria` in ruminants[^1]: Bacteria live in their gut, help them digest plants' cellulose
  - `gut flora` of humans: they get food, they `produce Vitamins` K,B, detoxify, `prevent pathogens' reproduction` 
- There is also a type of symbiosis where `partners can live w/o each other` (e.g zebras signal danger to each other)

### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Commensalism (+,0):
- `Only one` member `gets advantages`
- No impact on other partner
- Examples:
  - `Scavengers` eat predators' leftovers
  - `Sparrows` live in `storks' nests` and eat leftovers/food waste
  - Mosses (+) live on tree trunks(0)

### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Antibiosis (0,-)
- Interaction between `microorganisms`
- Neutral partner produces `metabolic product` which `inhibits reproduction` of other partner
- Example:
  - `Penicillium` fungus

### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Predation (+,-)
- Herbivores: They are `predators of plants`, but the `plant doesn't necessarily die`
- Carnivores: `Kill their prey` in most cases
- Predator & prey have great impact on eachother's population
- Example:
  - Long eared owl

### <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Parasitism (+, -)
- Parasite consumes host's organis compounds
- Parasites usually don't kill their host
- `Ectoparasites:` Live on the outside of host
- `Endoparasites:` Live inside the host

### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Competition (-, -):
- Can happen for `food, water, light, territory`
- Impacts number of individuals
- Populations with the same needs, can't live beside each other
  - one of them will leave/die
