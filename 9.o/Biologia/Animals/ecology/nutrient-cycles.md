# Nutrient cycles

- The biological elements/molecules are in permanent circulation between the 
organisms and the abiotic environment factors
- Circulations of the most important biological elements/compounds:

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> _Carbon cycle_
- air & water's CO<sub>2</sub>
- During photosynthesis: inorganic carbon is built (glucose)
- During biochemical processes other macromolecules are made (carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids)
- Burning of organic compounds CO<sub>2</sub> is released

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> _Nitrogen cycle_
- Bacteria convert N<sub>2</sub> to ammonia/nitrates/nitrites
- Most N<sub>2</sub> is in the atmosphere
- Plants can assimilate ammonia, nitrite, nitrate
- Denitrifying bacteria convert nitrate, nitrite to N<sub>2</sub>


## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> _Water cycle_
- Starts from water vapour in air
- Organisms consume water by drinking/eating
- Plants lose water with evapotranspiration
- Animals lose water with waste products
- Water can be stored in ice, groundwater, oceans/seas

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> _Phosphorous cycle_
- No air needed for the phosphorous cycle
- Weathering of rocks --> Water & soil phosphorous content increases
- Plants get it in dissolved form PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>
- Animals get it from water/food
- Decomposing bacteria convert phosphate back into phosphorous
