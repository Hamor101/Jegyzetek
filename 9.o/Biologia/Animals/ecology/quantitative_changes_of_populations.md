# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Quantitative changes of populations
- Depends on:
  - `Growth rate:` Birth rate - Death rate
  - `Carrying capacity` of the environment:</span> Maximal population load of an environment
  - `Immigration / Emigration`
## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Carrying capacity
- Affects `population size`
- After a certain population size, the environment is in danger
- Future of population depends on age of individuals and their fertility
- Many young individuals --> Growth of pop. in the future
- Many fertile adult --> steady growth
- Many older individuals --> population of 
- Living beings can be divided into two groups:
  - `R strategy`
  - `K strategy`
  
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">R strategy
- `Fast` reproduction
- Many offspring
- Short lifetime
- no long term adaptation
- Under favorable conditions --> fast reproduction
- After reaching carrying capacity --> Many die
- E.g Rodents, insects

### <span style="color:#fabd2f">K strategy
- `Slower` develpoment
- few offspring
- Long lifetime
- long term adaptation
- More time to reproduce --> Slow pop. growth 
- Their population is around the carrying capacity
- E.g Big mammals, primates, birds
