# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Human genetic disorders
- Dominant-recessive inheritance --> they are rare
- Autosomal disorders: only heterozygous parents

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Albinism
- Complete or partial abscence of melanin
- From the recessive allele the tyrosinase enzyme can not be synthesized which is needed to produce melanin
- Result is little to no pigmentation --> Extremely pale skin, white hair

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Lactose intolerance
- Capability to digest lactose is an evolutionary advantage
- People who are lactose intolerant, cannot produce lactase --> they cannot digest lactose into monosaccharides
- Undigested lactose in the colon --> absorbs water --> diarrhea

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Phenylketonuria
- Serious metabolic problem
- Cannot break down phenylalanine
- From phenylalanine --> Toxic compounds --> Nervous system damage

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Hip dysplasia
- Several forms
- Present mainly in females
- Cause:
  - Inappropriate development of head of the femur/acetabulum[^1]
- Preventable w/ usage of Pavlik harness
- Without prevention or treatment, serious problems can occur (pain in hip, femur dislocation)

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Color vision deficiency
- Inherited on X chromosome
- More common among males (because only X chromosome --> No 'backup')
- Problem with sensory neurons in the eyes
  - 1-2 sensory cones can't produce the pigment, that color can't be sensed
