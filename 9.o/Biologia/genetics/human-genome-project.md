# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Human genome project
- Ran between 1990-2006
- International project (US, UK, CN, JP, FR, GE, CA)
- Aim: to `map the human genome`
- Further aims:
  - determine sequence of nucleotides
  - identify places of genes on chromosomes
  - identify task of genes
- Several problems:
  - Specialised computer programs were neeeded
  - Ethical, moral, legal issues
  - Required a lot of money
##
- Identified 3.3b nucleotide pairs
- Identified 23 000 genes
- Closest relative: Bonobo --> 99% match
- 2 humans' DNA matches 99.9%
- Cradle of modern human species (Homo sapiens sapiens) is Africa

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Utility
- Enables scientists to
  - Find genes which `cause diseases`
  - Search for `evolutionary connections`
  - `Research cancer` better
  - Sequence `genomes of other species`

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Difficulties
- Ethical & moral:
  - Humans shouldn't be reduced to objects/data
  - Wealthy people can treat themselves & their families
- Legal:
  - Who has the rights to someone's genetic background
  - 1 human's genetic information contains info about his/her relatives as well -- Consent must be given
