# `Earthquakes`
- Severity is measure on the richter-scale (it measures severity by amount of equivalent explosive charge)
- Earthquakes mostly happen at plate boundaries
- They can trigger volcanic eruptions
- Severity can also be measured after the earthquake with the mercalli scale

## `Types of seismic waves`

### `P waves`
- P for primary (because they occur first)
- Push-pull motion
- Movement happens in the same direction of wave travel
- Travel through any material
- Fastest waves

### `S waves`
- Secondary waves
- Slower than P waves
- Mostly responsible for after effects of earthquak
- Particles move perpendicular to wave direction
- They can only travel through **solids** (meaning they cannot go **through** the earth)
