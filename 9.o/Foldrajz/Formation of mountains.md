# Formation of mountains
`Mountain: Natural landform reaching a high elevation`
- Usually narrow summits
- Steep slopes
- Orogeny: Process of mountain formation
- In Hungary: A mountains is a landform at least 500m above sea level
- Mountain range: Group of adjacent mountains with similar formation process/structure
- Mountain system: group of adjacent mountain ranges (e.g: appalachian mountains)
- Mountain belts: Large group of mountains including mountain ranges and systems:
  - Two major belts
    1. Circum-Pacific belt
    2. Eurasian-melanesian belt
- Both belts are located around convergent plate boundaries
- Isostasy: 
    - State of gravitational equilibrium between the lithosphere and astenosphere
    - Thickness or density differences will determine how high or low the mountain will be
## 4 main mountain types
    - Volcanic mountains - Due to magma upwelling
    - Folded mountains [^1]
    - Fault block mountains [^2]
    - Dome mountains

[^2]: Röghegységek

## Folded mountains
- Sedimentary rock gets compressed into folded mountains from pressure on both sides
- Convergent boundaries
- Some of the highest mountain ranges
- They form sinclines and anticlines
    - Anticlines: Fold of the mountain that folds upwards (arch-shape)
    - Synclines: Fold of the mountain that folds downwards (U-shape)
## Fault-block mountains
- Crust is broken into large blocks and lifted above surrounding crust
- Faulting tilted blocks formg gently sloping mountains
