------------------------------
Priviliges and inhabitants of towns, guilds, local & long-distance trade
```

- `Intro`
   -
   - Yap sesh 2.
   - Conditions that led to the appearance of towns
     - Warm-up, new tech, no more raids --> surplus
     - surplus --> trade
     - trade --> Industry appears
   - Ppl don't really know `WHY` towns appeared
   - `HOW` towns appeared:
     - people came together
     - people decided the landlord kinda sucks
     - They either `bought` or `fought for` autonomy
- `Main part:`
   -
   - Largest group: plebeians
   - Plebeians:
     - no citizenship
     - no skills
     - no (constant) job
     - (no bitches)
   - Town leadership was eventually under control of patricians[^2]
   - Patricians were usually traders
   - Other burghers were craftsmen
   - craftsmen created guilds
   - Purpose of guilds:
     - Standardize things about a profession (working hours, tools, production quality)
     - Protect standard of living for tradesmen
   - In towns you had to be the member of a guild to follow a certain profession (else they'd get mad)
   - The appearance of guilds, tradesmen & surplus meant that people had things to trade with --> short & long distance trade appeared
- `Summary:`
  - 
  - Medieval towns offered fairly high standards of living compared to their time period
  - They weren't flawless (dirty, smelly, plague-ridden)
  - They were very important for trade
