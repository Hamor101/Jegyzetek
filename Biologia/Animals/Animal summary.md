# Invertebrate summary
1. Where can we find epithelial tissue -> Outside of the body, surface of organs, cavities
2. Connective tissue types:
   - Loose
   - Dense
   - Blood
   - Adipose
   - Supporting
3. 2 types of supporting connective tissue:
   - Bone - solid(cuz minerals), somewhat elastic(cuz protein)
   - Cartilage - flexible
4. 2 types of dense connective tissue, what can be connected by them?
   -  Tendons - muscles to bones - inflexbible
   -  Ligaments - Bones to bones - flexible
5. tasks of adipose tissue
   - Nutrient storage
   - Insulation
   - Mechanical protection
6. what are the components of the blood?
   - Plasma
   - Blood cells
     - Red
     - White
     - Platelets
   - 48% Blood cells, 52% Plasma
7. 2 types of cells in nervous tissue
   - Neuron - signal transmission between each other
   - Neuroglia - feeding, protection of neurons, speeds up transmission speed
8. 3 muscle types
   - Striated
     - Voluntary
     - Strong
     - exhaustible
   - Smooth
     - Involuntary
     - Weak
     - sustained
   - Cardiac
     - Involuntary
     - Strong
     - sustained
9. `Porifera`
   - Non-motile
   - Assymetric
   - No organs/tissues
   - Specialized cells
   - Invertebrates
   - Filter-feeders
   - Can regenerate
10. `2 groups of Cnidarians and characterization`
   - Corals
     - Sessile
     - Have exoskeleton
     - Colonies
     - Symbiosis with algae
   - Jellyfish
     - Free living
     - Predators
11. `Worms`
   - Flatworms
     - Oldest
     - Rudimentary gut
     - Only **one** opening
     - Carnivores/parasites
     - Live in waters
   - Annelids
     - Most advanced
     - Round, segmented body
     - internal organs
     - 3 part git
     - 2 openings
     - Free living
       - waters
       - soil
     - Hermaphrodites
     - Detritivores/parasites
12. `Gastropods reproduction, respiration`
   - Hermaphrodites
   - Mutual fertilization
   - respiration:
     - Gills in water
     - Lung on land
13. `Bivalvia's nutrition, reproduction`
   - Filter-feeders
   - External fertilization
   - Separate sexes
14. `Cephalopod circulation`
   - Closed
   - Internal fertilization
   - Most developed senses
15. `Arthropods exoskeleton`
   - Protection from dessication, physical damage
   - Part of musculoskeletal system, striated muscle inside
16. `Arthropod respiration, circulation, body parts`
   - Respiration
     - Gills in water
     - Book lung for arachnida
     - Trachea for insects
   - Circulation 
     - Open 
     - No blood, hemolymph
     - For insects, it doesn't transport respiratory gases
   - Body parts
     - Head - sensory organs, mouth, brain
     - Thorax - limbs / wings
     - Abdomen - organs
     - Can have fused body parts
17. `Crustaceans nutrition`
   - Can be herbivores, carnivores, omnivores
   - Can be marine, sometimes terrestrial
18. `5 things about arachnida`
   - Cephalothorax and Abdomen
   - Cephalothorax has organs
   - 4 pairs of walking legs 
   - Predators/parasites
19. `Groups of arachnida`
   - Aranaea - spiders
   - Acari - ticks/mites
   - Scorpion
   - `Aranaea`
     - make webs (spinneret)
     - External digestion
20. `Insects heads`
   - Compound eyes / spot eyes
   - Antennae
   - Mouth part
21. `Insects' abdomen`
   - Internal organs
   - Trachea
   - Reproductive organs
22. `3 mouthparts + 1-1 example`
   - Siphoning - butterflies
   - Piercing-sucking - mosquito
   - Spongins - bees/flies
   - Chewing - bugs
23. `Insects' metamorphosis`
   - Complete
     - Different larva and adult
     - Process
       - Larva
       - Pupa
       - Adult
   - Incomplete
     - No pupa stage
24. `Echinoderms`
   - Endoskeleton made by skin
