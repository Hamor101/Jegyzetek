# `Arthropods`
- Arthtropods - (from **arthro** meaning joint)
- **Bilateral** symmetry
- Most abundant phylum (1.2 million species)
- Limbs are joined to the appendages
- Exosekeleton made of **chitin**

- `Exoskeleton functions:`
  - Protection from dessication, chemicals, physical damage
  - Part of musculoskeletal system, striated muscle attached inside
- `Disadvantages:`
  - After a size it becomes too heavy --> Slower movement --> Death
  - This limits body size
  - **Solution: Shedding/molting**

### `Body structure:`
- **Head** : sensory organs, moutparts, brain
- **Thorax** : limbs (and wings)
- **Abdomen** : Internal organs
- Body parts can be fused[^1]
    ### `Thorax`
    - _Digestive system_
      - 3 segments (foregut, midgut, hindgut)
      - 2 orifices (mouth, anus)
[^1]: E.g: cephalothorax contains the head and the thorax in one in the case of spiders


### `Respiration` 
- Gills in water
- Trachea (légcső) for insects
- Book lung for arachnids

### `Circulation`
- Open circulation
- No blood, they have hemolymph
- For insects, it doesn't transport respiratory gasess

### `Reproduction`
- Separate sexes
- Can have sexual dimorphism
- Develop with metamorphosis in several cases (Complete metamorphosis)

### `Nervous system & senses`
- Centralized ganglia, insects have brain
- Developed senses:
  - Eye spots
  - Compound eyes
  - Hearing
  - Smelling
  - Detecting vibration
  - Balance
- 3 well-known classes:
  1. Crustaceans - Rákok
  2. Arachnida - Pókszabásúak
  3. Insecta - Rovarok

## `Crustaceans`
- Mainly **aquatic**
- Some in damp habitats
- Really diverse 0-1mm-3.5m
- Can have stiff exoskeleton
  - Can contain calcium & chitin
- `Nutrition:`
  - Omnivores
  - Scavengers
  - Predators
  - Herbivores
- Barnacle : Kacsakagyló
- Crab : Tarisznyarák
- Crayfish : Folyami rák
- Lobster : Homár
- Hermit crab : Remeterák
- Prawn, shrimp : Garnéla
- `Body structure:`
  - Cephalothorax
    - Antennae
    - Mouthparts
    - feeding legs
    - Walking legs
    - Contains internal organs
