# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Reproductive behaviours

- Aim: Maintaining the species
- Mainly innate
- `Steps`:
  - Mate choice
  - courtship
  - mating
  - parental care

### <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Mate choice
- Recognition of conspecific[^1] is important
- based on innate behaviour
- Several methods:
  - `Auditory:`
    - Locusts, crickets males `chirr` to attract females
  - `Visual:`
    - E.g color scheme of some male fish change during breeding season
    - Birds use plumage color (e.g Peacocks)
  - `Chemical:`
    - `Females` release pheromones
    - Used by insects, dogs etc.
  - `Harem keeper species:`
    - Males fight for dominant position


### <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Courtship and mating
- Evolutionary
- Based on innate patterns
- External/Internally fertilized species use it to lower distance between members, it also helps sexual excitement
- e.g coutrship of male fish starts the females' egg release

### Parental care
- Two main groups:
  - `Quality over quantity` 
    -  More energy put into `raising` the offspring
    -  Produces `higher quality` offspring
    -  Costs a lot of `food and energy`
    -  E.g: Humans, Alrticial birds, Social insects take care of the young
  - `Quantity over quality` 
    - More energy put into `creating gametes`, but many offspring die


### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Division of labour & Period of time:
- `Periodic monogamy:`
  - Choose one partner for one breeding season
- `Lifelong monogamy:`
  - Choose mate for life
  - E.g: Swans, storks
- `Polygamy:`
  - 1 male several females
  - Can work in cases where females can raise offspring on their own
  - ONLY `herbivorous mammals`
