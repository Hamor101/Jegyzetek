# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Communication of animals

- Present in both social and solitary animals
- Used to signal other animals about `motivations` and `state`

- Types:
  - Visual
  - Chemical
  - Auditory

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Visual
- Short range
- `Posture` -- maintaining hierarchy
- `Facial expressions` -- e.g primates
- `Color`:
  - Vivid colors mean toxicity
  - Also used for mating
- `Bioluminescence:`
  - Use of light to find mate
  - Cane be used as warning signal
- `Dancing:`
  - Information about food sources
    - Amount
    - direction
    - distance

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Chemical
- Effective over `long distances`
- Depends on `carrier medium` (air, water)
- Can be `slow`
- Signals: `Pheromones` (produced by skin glands)
- Can be produced in `large amounts`
- Effective in `low concentration`
- Receiver can sense it with `tongue` or `nose`
- `Usage:`
  - Signing `territory`:
    - Borders are signed with `urine`
  - Finding `mates`:
    - E.g butterfly males can smell 1-2 molecules of female pheromone
  - Signalling `danger`
    - E.g ants can release `pheromones` that `signal other ants` whether to `fight` or `flee`
  - Mark `food`
    - `Pheromone trails` can be left which other insects follow to find food, then `get home`
  - Recognizing `members of a group`
    - e.g rats living together have a `similar smell`

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Auditory
- Works over a `long distance`
- `Spreads quickly` in both water and air
- Some signs are `interspecific`[^1] --> Loud = Danger
- `Innate` as well as `learned` (imitative) components
- `Usage:`
  - `Warning` of danger
  - Attracting `mates`
    - Mostly birds
  - Marking `territory`
    - E.g howling of wolves
  - Parent-offspring `recognition`
    - They can recognize eachother based on `voice`
  - Ultrasound `orientation`, `hunting`
