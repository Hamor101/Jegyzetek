# Ethology
- The study of the behaviour of animals
- Studies can be done in laboratories or natural environments
- Animal behaviour is complex
  - They have evolutionary reasons
- Ethology needs a lot of information from backgrounds:
  - Genetics
  - Neuroanatomy
  - Biochemistry
  - Ecology
- Overall animal behaviour cannot be examined, so it is divided into action patterns
- There are innate and learned behaviours
