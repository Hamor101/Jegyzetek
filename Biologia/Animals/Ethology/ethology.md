# Ethology

## `Basics`

- The study of the behaviour of animals
- Studies can be done in laboratories or natural environments
- Animal behaviour is complex
  - They have evolutionary reasons
- Ethology needs a lot of information from backgrounds:
  - Genetics
  - Neuroanatomy
  - Biochemistry
  - Ecology
- Overall animal behaviour cannot be examined, so it is divided into action patterns
- There are innate and learned behaviours
- Behaviours are repsonses to stimuli, but the response depends on the animal's motivation
- Motivations: hunger, thirst, fear, curiosity, sexual desire
- Stimulus vs response:

|Motivation|Stimulus|Response|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Low motivation|Low Stimulus|No response|
|Low motivation|Stronger stimulus|Rare response|
|Stronger motivation|Stronger stimulus|response|**

- `Two basic groups of behaviour`
  - Innate(öröklött) -- found in genes, curcial for survival
  - Learned(tanult) -- evolved during life
- More advanced species have more learned behaviour

## `Innate behaviour`
- All members of a species perform in the same way 
- Doesn't require former experience
- Crucial for survival
- <mark>Cannot change
- Triggered by a _key stimulus_
- E.g: Hiding from predators, fear of darkness, fear of heights, human babies grip reflex
- `Types:`
  - Unconditioned reflex
  - Supernormal stimulus


### `Unconditioned reflex:`
  - Automatic reaction to key stimulus
  - Fixed action patterns[^1]:
    - Shown in order
    - They never change
    - Done with repetition
    - Examples:
      -  Newborn chicks of chicken escape from every flying object that resembles a predator
      -  Roll reflex: When touching something how, we pull our hand away

### `Supernormal stimulus:`
  - More intense stimulus --> more intense repsonse
  - e.g: cuckoo chicks opening their mouth wider so their "parents" give them more food 
[^1]: Öröklött mozgáskombináció (e.g dogs burying food)

## `Learned behaviour`
- **Some genetic background**, but flexible
- Can change according to environment
- Important for adaptation
- Gives advantage to individual **and** its group

- `Types:`
  - `Habituation (megszokás):`
    - Important in lowering stress
    - **The ability to get used to neutral stimuli**
    - e.g: Seagull chicks learn not to be afraid of falling leaves
  - `Imprinting (bevésődés):`
    - Animal's brain sensitive to stimulus in early stage of life
    - Key stimulus triggers response crucial to survival
    - e.g: Precocial chicks follow the first moving object after being born (for 10-18 hrs after hatching)
  - `Associative learning / Conditioned reflex:`
    - Based on unconditioned reflex
    - Reflex is connected with different stimulus
    - Needs repetition
    - E.g: Pavlov's dogs
  - `Operant conditioning:`
    - Animal can influence its environment
    - for a specific behaviour it gets a reward
    - Example:
        - Skinner box
          - Hungry rat put into box
          - When it pulls a lever, it gets food
          - It eventually learns that the lever is used for food
  - `Imitative / observational learning:`
    - Animals with intelligence can learn from eachother
    - Birds, monkeys can copy behavioural patterns
  - `Insight learning:`
    - Used by the most intelligent species
    - Using former experiences to solve new problem without attempts
    - E.g: Chimp + banana on ceiling => Chimp on box
