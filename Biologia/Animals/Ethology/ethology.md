# Ethology

## `Basics`

- The study of the behaviour of animals
- Studies can be done in laboratories or natural environments
- Animal behaviour is complex
  - They have evolutionary reasons
- Ethology needs a lot of information from backgrounds:
  - Genetics
  - Neuroanatomy
  - Biochemistry
  - Ecology
- Overall animal behaviour cannot be examined, so it is divided into action patterns
- There are innate and learned behaviours
- Behaviours are repsonses to stimuli, but the response depends on the animal's motivation
- Motivations: hunger, thirst, fear, curiosity, sexual desire
- Stimulus vs response:

|Motivation|Stimulus|Response|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Low motivation|Low Stimulus|No response|
|Low motivation|Stronger stimulus|Rare response|
|Stronger motivation|Stronger stimulus|response|**

- `Two basic groups of behaviour`
  - Innate(öröklött) -- found in genes, curcial for survival
  - Learned(tanult) -- evolved during life
- More advanced species have more learned behaviour

## `Innate behaviour`
- All members of a species perform in the same way 
- Doesn't require former experience
- Crucial for survival
- <mark>Cannot change
- Triggered by a _key stimulus_
- E.g: Hiding from predators, fear of darkness, fear of heights, human babies grip reflex
- `Types:`
  - `Unconditioned reflex:`
    - Automatic reaction to key stimulus
    - e.g Newborn chicks of chicken escape from every flying object that resembles a predator
