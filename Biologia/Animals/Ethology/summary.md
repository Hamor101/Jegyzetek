- What is ethology
  - Study of the behaviour of animals
- What is behaviour?
  - A Response to a stimulus
  - Response strength based on the motivation and the strength of the stimulus
- List 3 motivations?
  - Thirst
  - Hunger
  - Sexual desire
  - Fear
  - Curiosity
- When does the response have a high chance?
  - Strong motivation
  - Strong stimulus
- Compare innate and learned behaviour briefly
  - Innate is `inherited`, no need for experience
  - Learned is based on `life experiences` + `genes`
- Characterize innate behaviour in 4 points:
  - Inherited
  - Independent from experience
  - All members of a species have it (=they all show same response to key stimulus)
  - Rigid (= cannot change)
  - necessary for survival
- Characterize the unconditioned reflex through an example:
  - 1
    - Loud, high pitched sound --> Means danger (interspecific sign)
    - We automatically look at source, to avoid danger
  - 2
    - Grasping reflex on babies --> to avoid falling
  - 3 Roll reflex
    - Touching something dangerous, hot --> We pull away our hand to avoid danger/more injuries
- Characterize fixed action pattern through an example:
  - Hiding food
    - No hunger + extra food --> animals will search a place
    - Dig hole
    - Put food in hole
    - Bury
    - Go back later to eat 
- What can be a supernormal stimulus in case of birds:
  - Cuckoo chicks have brightly coloured throat, big mouth --> parent bird instinctively feeds them more
- Characterize learned behaviour in 4 points:
  - Genetic background, but flexible
  - Adapts to changing environment
  - Important to adaptation
  - Gives advantages to individuals and their group as well
  - based on former experience

- Explain what is habituation through an example
  - Seagull chicks learn not to be afraid of leaves after a while
- What is imprinting? Who discovered it? What is the task of imprinting
  - After hatching, baby ducks follow the first moving thing they species
  - Ducks only imprint for a short time
  - Important to learn how to find food, and recognize conspecific
  - Discovered by: Lorenz Conrad
- Associative learning through example:
  - Pavlov's dogs
  - Dogs learned to associate a neutral stimulus with receiving food
- Operant conditioning through example:
  - Example: SKinner box
  - Put a rat into the skinner box
  - Rat pulls lever by accident --> receives food
  - Rat learns that pushing lever means getting food
- Characterize observational learning
  - Example: monkeys
  - Monkeys/octopi can observe other monkeys to learn skills (e.g opening coconuts)
- Insight learning through an example:
  - Most advanced type of learning
  - Only present in primates
  - Animals can "invent" solutions to problems
  - E.g:
    - Monkeys put into box with food out of reach --> they learn to stack boxes
- Aims of communication:
  - Finding mate
  - Give signals to other members of a species (e.g about mood)
  - Mark territory --> avoid fights

- Communication chart:
  |x|Visual|Chemical|Auditory|
  |-----|-----|-----|-----|
  |Receiver sense it with|Eyes|Nose/tongue|Ear|
  |Range|Shorter|Long|Long| 
- 3 visual communication types with examples:
  - Posture - can be used to communicate dominance/submission (e.g wolves)
  - Colors/dances - Used for courtship
  - Waggle dance (in the case of bees) - Communicates information about a food source (distance, directionm, amount)
- Pheromones
  - Hormone-like structures
  - Secreted by skin glands
- How can receiver sense pheromones:
  - Smelling/tasting
- 3 chemical communication types with examples:
  - `Ants` can use `pheromones` to communicate food sources
  - `Wolves` can use `Urine` to mark territory
  - `Rats` can `recognize each other` based on smell
- Auditory communication:
  - Voice can be used to recognize parent/offspring (e.g penguins)
  - Howling can be used to mark territory (e.g wolves)
  - Songs can be used for courtship (e.g songbirds)
  - Specific sound patterns can be used as names (e.g dolphins)
  - Chirr / croak of males also to attract females
- 4 examples of mate choice:
  - Crickets use chirrs to attract females
  - Frogs croak to attract females
  - Peacocks use plumage to -||-
  - Some birds also dance
- Why is courtship important:
  - Lowers distance between partners
  - Synchronizes maturation of gametes between the two members of a species in the case of external fertilization
- Animals with/without parental care:

 |x|Without parental care|With parental care| 
 |-----|-----|-----|
 |Nr. of offspring|High|Low| 
 |Chance of survival|Low|High| 
 |Energy investment|Creation of gametes|Raising of offspring| 

- Which animals invest the most in parental care and how:
  - Mammals, birds
    - Mammals
      - Invest in milk
      - Gestation
  - Birds 
    - Invest energy in raising chicks
- Relationship types and characteristics:
  - Periodic monogamy:
    - Animals are monogamous but only for one breeding season
  - Lifelong monogamy:
    - Animals chose partner for life 
  - Polygamy:
    - Mainly in herbivores
    - Low energy needed to feed adults and offspring --> no requirement for two parents
