# Vertebrates

- Most advanced group of animals
- General characteristics:
  - Well developed brain and senses
  - Vertebral column- made of vertebrae, center of endoskeleton
  - Endoskeleton made of cartilage and/or bone
  - 2 pairs of appendages [^1]
  - respiration: gills/lungs
  - excretion: kidney
  - separate sexes, external/internal fertilization

- `Groups:`
    1. Chondrichthyes = Porcos halak
    2. Osteichthyes = Csontos halak
    3. Amphibians = kétéltűek
    4. Reptiles = hüllők
    5. Aves = Madarak
    6. Mammals = Emlősok
[^1]: fins or limbs

### `Chondrichthyes`
- only marine species
- endoskeleton: cartilage (no bone)
- tough skin
- paired and unpaired fins
- respiration: gills [^2]
- predators
- Interesting reproduction
  - Internal fertilization
  - 3 types:
    - Oviparous: lay eggs
    - Viviparous: give birth
    - ovoviviparious: eggs remain in mother's body
[^2]: they have to swim to refresh water around gills

### `Ostheichthyes:`
- marine and freshwater
- endoskeleton: bone
- skin: non-keratinized, covered with scales / mucus
- paired and unpaired fins
- respiration: gills covered with operculum[^3] 
- swim/air bladder filled with air --> Helps with buoyancy
- lateral line (!Not present in chondrichtyes!)
    - Sensory organ
    - Mechanoreceptors detectchange of flow
- Circulation:
    - One blood stream
    - One atrium/ventricle
- Reproduction:
    - External fertilization | Gametes meet in water

## `Amphibians:`
- Frogs, toads, newts, salamanders belong here
- Partly adapted to terrestrial life, but their reproduction depends on water
- Skin respiration --> They need moist air to breathe
- Live in/near fresh waters and damp habitats
- `Skin:`
    - Non-keratinized
    - Has mucus
    - responsible for 60% of respiration
    - can have venom glands

- Tetrapods:[^4]
    - Hind legs for jumping

- `Respiration:`
    - tadpoles have gills
    - Adults use lungs and cutaneous respiration[^5]
    - No diaphragm, inhalation is done with expansion of oral cavity

- `Circulation:`
    - heart with 3 chambers
        - 2 atria, 1 ventricle
    - 2 bloodstreams:
        - Pulmonary cirulcation --> To lungs
        - Systemic circulation --> To body
    - Two types of blood are mixed in the ventricle

- `Nutrition:`
    - Tadpoles: Herbivores / omnivores
    - Adults: Predators
    - Adults have long tongue to catch prey

- `Sensory system:`
    - Far-focused eyes
    - Good hearing (for reproduction)
    - Weak smell

- `Reproduction:`
    - External fertilization, in water
    - Gametes are emitted into the water throguh the cloace
    - Many are oviparous
    - Eggs have transparent gelatinous covering
        - Contains stored food
    - Develop with metamorphosis
- `Salamander reproduction:`
    - Internal fertilization
    - Can live far from water (only need moisture)
    - Can lay eggs in caves/cavities
    - Male lays down its spermatophore, female sucks it up with cloaca
    - Some of them are ovoviviparous

[^3]: Operculum covers the gills and helps refresh water around them
[^4]: four limbs
[^5]: skin respiration

## `Reptiles`
- Terrestrial [^6]
- Reproduction independent from water
- Offspring develop in egg
- Ectothermic: Body temperature depends on environment temperature
- Heavily keratinized skin
  - Protects from dessication
  - Can create armors
  - Doesn't grow with them --> they have to moult
- `Respiration:`
  - (Slightly) Branched lungs
- `Circulation:`
  - 4-chambered heart
  - 2 atria, 2 ventricles
  - Septum is not full --> Bloodstreams can mix
- `Nutrition:`
  - Mostly predators / scavengers
  - Some tortoises are herbivores
  - Rootless teeth (except in crocodiles)
- `Senses:`
    - Touch/Taste is weak
    - Weak smell
    - Sight and hearing are strong
    - Can sense vibrations
    - Extra sensory organs:
      - Pit organ : infrared radiation sensor
      - Jacobson's organ : Smelling-tasting chemoreceptor [^7]

[^6]:First true terrestrial animals, as their reproduction doesn't depend on water
[^7]: This is why snakes stick their tongues out to smell
