# Summary
- Vertebrate skeleton, respiration, reproduction:
  - Skeleton: bone and cartilage
  - Branched lungs/Gills/Skin respiration
  - internal | external
- 5 things about chondrichtyes
  - Skeleton is made of only cartilage
  - Tough skin (no scales)
  - Internal fertilization
  - Only predators

- Compare chondrichtyes and osteichthyes
    |x|Skin|Swim bladder|Operculum|fertilization|
    |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
    |Chondrichthyes|Hard skin|no|no|internal| 
    |Ostheichthyes|Scales|yes|yes|external|

- Ostheichthyes circulation respiration reproduction:
  - Circulation: 1 atria, 1 ventricle, one bloodstream
  - Respiration: Gills with operculum
  - Reproduction: External fertilization, gametes meet in water

- Why are amphibians partly terrestrial:
  - Need water for reproduction
  - Need moisture for skin respiration

- Amphibian respiration:
  - 3 chambered heart
  - 2 atria, 1 ventricle

- Compare circulation of vertebrates:
    |x|Amphibians|Reptiles|Aves/mammals|

- Why are reptiles true terrestrial animals:
  - Internal fertilization --> can protect offspring from dessication
  - Branched lungs
  - Heavily keratinized skin --> protects from dessication

- What does ectothermic mean:
  - Have to use the environment to maintain body temperature

- Reptile senses:
  - Underdeveloped taste, touch
  - Very good sight, smelling
  - Special sensory organs: jacobson's organ, pit organ(detects IR radiation)

- 5 Features of snakes:
  - No legs (imagine xd)
  - They move with intercostal muscles
  - Predators (kill with venom or choking)
  - Jacobson organ + pit organ 
  - Kills with  venom or constriction (choking)

- What is needed for endothermic animals
  - Thermoregulatory center
  - Well developed circulatory/respiratory system
  - More food

- Why do birds have the most developed respiration?
  - They have double respiration with air sacs
  - When air comes back from the air sacs, gas exchange happens again

- Reproduction of Aves
  - Internal fertilization (through the cloaca, in the oviduct)
  - Oviparous
  - Walls of oviduct makes the layers of the eggs
  - They incubate --> Calcerous egg
  - Chick can be precocial or altricial

- Compare precocial and altritial
  - Altritial:
    - Undeveloped state when hatching
    - blind
    - cannot feed themselves
    - ugly af
  - Precocial:
    - well developed at hatching
    - can see
    - can follow their parents
    - They have feathers

- Compare mammals based on incisors:
  - Herbivores: Massive, big incisors
  - Carnivores: Sharp, Small
  - Omnivores: flat, medium sized

- Compare mammals based on molars:
  - Herbivores: Wrinkled (redős)
  - Carnivores: Crested (tarajos)
  - Omnivores: Tuberous (gumós)

- Explain echolocation
  - Example bats
  - They create ultrasound in the throat, which bounces off objects, their brain creates an image from the returnign sound


- Name organs of mammals:
  - Female mating organ: Vagina
  - Pllace of fertilization: 
  - Place of implantation: Endometrium

- Task of placenta:
  - Fetus gets oxygen and nutrients from mother's blood through the placenta
  - Also removes waste products from the fetus
  
- Prototheria
  - Exceptional, because they have cloaca and eggs
  - They also have mammary glands (but no nipple)
  - Example: Platypus 
  - They live in new guinea

- Marsupialia:
  - offspring develop in uterus
  - After this they climb into the pouch
  - Habitat: Central australia and south america
