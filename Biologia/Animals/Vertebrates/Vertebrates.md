# Vertebrates

- Most advanced group of animals
- General characteristics:
  - Well developed brain and senses
  - Vertebral column- made of vertebrae, center of endoskeleton
  - Endoskeleton made of cartilage and/or bone
  - 2 pairs of appendages [^1]
  - respiration: gills/lungs
  - excretion: kidney
  - separate sexes, external/internal fertilization

- `Groups:`
    1. Chondrichthyes = Porcos halak
    2. Osteichthyes = Csontos halak
    3. Amphibians = kétéltűek
    4. Reptiles = hüllők

    - Viviparous: give birth
    - ovoviviparious: eggs remain in mother's body
[^2]: they have to swim to refresh water around gills

### `Ostheichthyes:`

- `Respiration:`
  - (Slightly) Branched lungs
- `Circulation:`
  - 4-chambered heart

[^6]:First true terrestrial animals, as their reproduction doesn't depend on water
[^7]: This is why snakes stick their tongues out to smell
