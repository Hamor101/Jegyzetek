# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Changes of communities in time
- Types:
  1. [`Cyclic changes`](#cyclic-changes)
  2. [`Succession`](#succession)

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Cyclic changes
- Seasons are `cycles`
- Composition of species `doesn't change`
- Their visible `life activities change`
- Based on `adaptation to environment`
- Kinds of strategies based on seasonal changes:
  - `Migration:` Often seen in birds
  - `Hibernation:` Ectotherms hibernate during winter
  - `Nesting period` in the perfect time
  - `Delayed development` of fetus: Deers can do this to avoid pregnancy/birth  while there is not enough food
- Temperate zone:
  - 
  - 4 seasons can be distinguished easily --> Perfect example for cyclic changes

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Succession
- Progressive process
- `Composition & structure` of communities `change`
- Communities change each other in order
- Most complex `climax community` will populate the area
- Steps of forest succession
  - bare rock, soil
  - mosses & lichens
  - annual grasses
  - perennial open grasses
  - perennial closed grasses
  - shrubs
  - open forest
  - closed forest -> climax community
