# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Characteristics of communities
- `Community:` Association of populations of 2 or more species livng in the same geographical area
- Populations interact with each other & abiotic environment factors
- Communities `get their names from vegetation`, which is based on climate
  - e.g grassland, oak forest, beech forest

- Communities are characterized by:
  1. `Species richness:`
    - `number of species` in the community
    - `higher richness:` `greater stability`, able to recover after disturbance
    - `Introducing new species breaks balance`, new competition can cause death of population
  2. Stratification
    - caused by different sizes and needs of orgnaisms
    - Creates `layers`
    - most complex: `rainforests`
    - Layers:
      - Canopy layer (felső lombkoronaszint)
      - understory trees layer (alsó lombkoronaszint)
      - shrub layer (cserjeszint)
      - herbaceous layer (gyepszint)
      - ground layer (talajszint)
  3. Pattern
    - Horizontal arrangement of organisms
    - Based on difference between abiotic factors
      - water distribution
      - light nutrient
      - type of reproduction
