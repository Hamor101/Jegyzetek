## Abiotic environment factors
- `Light:`
  - `Solar energy` of the Sun
  - Base of life
  - `Photosnthesis` uses light to create chemical energy
  - Chemical energy is found in bonds of organic compounds
  - `Parts of sunlight:`
    - UV (<400nm) harmful for DNA
    - Visible light (400-750nm)
    - IR (>750nm) heat, temperature
  - 50% of light emitted by the Sun is reflected back into space
  - Indirect light is reflected from clouds, dust, steam
  - Direct light:
    - 87-88% absorbed by surface
    - 10% reflected
    - 2-3% used by photosynthesis
  -  Ratio of direct and indirect light depends on:
     -  Latitude
     -  Altitude
     -  relief
     -  Vegetation
     -  Season
     -  Time of day
     -  Weather & clouds
  - Groups of plants based on need for light:
    - Light tolerant plants: Like direct light
    - Light and shadow tolerant plants: need both light and shadow
    - Shade tolerant plants:
      - direct light causes them damage, they need indirect light
  - the light influences animals:
    - Reproduction
    - Body temp
    - Orientation
    - Hibernation
  - Groups of animals based on activity:
    - Diurinal animals : active during daylight
    - Crepuscular animals : active during dawn and dusk
    - Nocturnal animals : Active during night
- `Temperature:`
  - Most heat energy comes from Sun
  - Heats up earth's surface
  - Earth's surface heats up the air
  - Greenhouse gases:
    - CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NOx, H<sub>2</sub>O
