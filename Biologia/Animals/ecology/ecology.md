## Abiotic environment factors
### `Light:`
  - `Solar energy` of the Sun
  - Base of life
  - `Photosnthesis` uses light to create chemical energy
  - Chemical energy is found in bonds of organic compounds
  - `Parts of sunlight:`
    - UV (<400nm) harmful for DNA
    - Visible light (400-750nm)
    - IR (>750nm) heat, temperature
  - 50% of light emitted by the Sun is reflected back into space
  - Indirect light is reflected from clouds, dust, steam
  - Direct light:
    - 87-88% absorbed by surface
    - 10% reflected
    - 2-3% used by photosynthesis
  -  Ratio of direct and indirect light depends on:
     -  Latitude
     -  Altitude
     -  relief
     -  Vegetation
     -  Season
     -  Time of day
     -  Weather & clouds
  - Groups of plants based on need for light:
    - Light tolerant plants: Like direct light
    - Light and shadow tolerant plants: need both light and shadow
    - Shade tolerant plants:
      - direct light causes them damage, they need indirect light
  - the light influences animals:
    - Reproduction
    - Body temp
    - Orientation
    - Hibernation
  - Groups of animals based on activity:
    - Diurinal animals : active during daylight
    - Crepuscular animals : active during dawn and dusk
    - Nocturnal animals : Active during night
- `Temperature:`
  - Most heat energy comes from Sun
  - Heats up earth's surface
  - Earth's surface heats up the air
  - Greenhouse gases:
    - CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NOx, H<sub>2</sub>O
    - Growth in volume of these gases causes increase in temperature (greenhouse effect) --> Result is global warming
  - Factors that influence the temperature of an area:
    - Distance from the equator (Latitude)
    - Distance from sea level (Altitude)
    - Presence of water
      - Water has a buffer effect
      - It has higher thermal capacity (more time to change temp)
    - Relief (e.g southern parts of hills are warmer)
    - Soil type
    - Water content in soil
    - Vegetation
  - `Temperature influences:`
    - Metabolism
    - Reproduction
    - Enzymes
      - They are only active at a given temperature
      - (e.g in the winter the enzymes needed for photosynthesis are inactive)
  - `Types of animals based on heat tolerance:`
    - Thermophilic (melegkedvelő): Narrow tolerance for heat, live in tropical areas
    - Temperate zone species: Broad tolerance for temperature
      - They have solutions for warm and cold weather as well (fur, fat etc.)
    - Cold loving species:
      - Narrow tolerance
      - Live in cold zones (taiga, polar regions)
  - `Types of animals based on body temperature:`
    - Endothermic: Thermoregulatory center in brain, they can control body temperature, they also have insulation
    - Ectothermic: Body temperature depends on environment
### `Water`
  - Essential for life
  - Requirement for biological processes
  - Conditions of water that can influence living organisms:
    - Density
    - Salinity
    - Temperature
    - Dissolved gas content
  - Water distribution is uneven arond the Earth
  - 2 groups of plants based on water supply:
    - poikilohydry (változó vízállapotú) -- Cannot regulate water loss, depend on the environment's water content (non-vascular plants belong here)
    - homoihydry -- Can regulate evapotranspiration, can have waterproof cuticle on epidermis, can change surface area of leaves (vascular plants belong here)
      - `Groups of homoihydry:`
        - Aquatic : live in water, have undeveloped roots
        - Marshland plants : intense water absorption and evapotranspiration
        - "Medium water supplied" plants : can tolerate drought for a while by lowering evapotranspiration, but not forever
        - Drought tolerant plants : long roots, small leaves, waxy cuticle
  - Animals and water:
    - Marine and freshwater species:
      - Don't have to protect against dessication
    - Humid habitat animals:
      - Need humidity in air
      - If air dries, they will hide
