# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Energy flow in the biosphere

- Base: `Sunlight`
- Photosynthesis: Sunlight --> `Chemical energy` of `organic compounds`
- `0.5%` of visible light can be used `during photosynthesis`[^1]
- Levels of food chain: `Trophic levels`
- Energy loss:
  - Caused by life activities
  - `90% per trophic level`
- Decomposers have an important role, because they can turn organic compounds --> inorganic
- `Inorganic` compounds are `poor in energy`, but they are `required for photosynthesis`
- `Energy enters` food chain `only once` 
- Energy is a one-way flow
