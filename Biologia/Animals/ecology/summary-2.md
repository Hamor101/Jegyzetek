# Sumary

- 3 components of an ecosystem
  - Producers
  - Consumers
  - Decomposers
- Why are producers important
  - `Base of every food chain`
  - can make `organic from inorganic compounds` /w the energy of `light`
- Characterize consumers briefly:
  - Always `heterotrophs`
  - Can be scavengers, omnivores, herbivores, detritivores
  - Can be primary, secondary, tertiary
- Why are decomposers important?
  - `Close the nutrient cycle`
  - They can transform `organic compounds to inorganic compounds`
- What is the base of life on Earth? Why?
  - Sunlight
  - Because: used during photosynthesis to make chemical energy in the bonds of the oranic compounds
- Causes of energy loss on each trophic level
  - Producers: Respiration, waste products, growth, heat loss
- Carbon cycle (drawing):
  1. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> content
  2. `Photosynthesis` --> organic carbon
  3. `Organic carbon` eaten by `heterotrophs`
  4. Decaying material / Fossil fuels
  5. Respiration / burning / breaking down of materials --> Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
- Water cycle (drawing):
    1. Atmospheric H<sub>2</sub>O
    2. Condensation
    3. Precipitation
    4. Infiltration
    5. Evaporation / Evapotranspiration --> Atmospheric H<sub>2</sub>O
    6. Respiration / Urine --> Atmospheric H<sub>2</sub>O
- Nitrogen cycle's importance:
  - Most important part are nitrogen-fixing bacteria
  - They make usable nitrogen compounds
  - NH<sub>3</sub>
  - NO<sub>2</sub>
- What is biomass?
  - All of the organic materials of an area in a given time
- Species richness:
  - Number of species in a community (the higher the better)
  - Stability depends on it
- What causes the stratification of communities?
  - difference in size of species
  - difference in needs
  - Biotic/abiotic factors
- What causes the pattern of species in a community?
  - Light
  - Relief
  - Water distribution
  - Reproduction of species
- Characterize the cyclic changes of communities briefly?
  - Periodic changes in the environment
  - Composition of species doesn't change, but their behaviour/visible activities do
- Characterize succession briefly:
  - One-way/progressive process
  - When species change each other and prepare circumstances for the next species
  - At the end we have the so-called climax community -- The community which is most complex on that climate
