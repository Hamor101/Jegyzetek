- What is ecology:
  - Study of `interactions` of populations and living organisms and their environments
- Population:
  - Members of a species `living together` in the `same place & time`, creating a `reproductive community`
- Community:
  - `2 or more populations` of species living in the `same geographic area`
  - Ex: Oak forest
- What is tolerance?
  - Adaptation/reaction of a species to the environment's factors
  - Can be illustrated with `bell curve`
- Difference between narrow & broad tolerance:
  - Broad: More broad tolerance means `larger living area`
  - Narrow: A certain `environment factor limits living place`
- Generalist & specialist species:
  - Generalist: Broad tolerance for multiple environment factors --> More places to live
  - Specialist: `Narrow tolerance` for `multiple environment factors` --> Fewer places to live
- 3 main parts of sunlight:
  - Visible --> vision & photosynthesis
  - UV --> Damages DNA
  - IR --> responsible for temperature
- Light influences in case of animals:
  - Reproduction
  - Hibernation
  - Migration
  - Activity (Nocturnal, Diurinal, Crepuscular, nocturnal)
- Greenhouse effect importance:
  - W/O greenhouse effect, avg. global temp would be: -10Â°C
- 4 factors that influence temperature of area:
  - distance to equator (latitude)
  - Altitude
  - Surface material
  - relief
  - Distance to large bodies of water
- Why is water essential for life:
  - Life was born in water
  - Part of every living oranism
  - Component of biochemical reactions
- Humid habitat animals vs. dry habitat animals:
  - Humid: Need moisture in the air (bc of non-keratinized skin)
  - Dry: Keratinized skin protects them from dessication, dense urine & dry faeces
- Definition of soil
  - Uppermost `fertile` layer of the Earth's crust
- 4 characteristics of soil important for living oranisms:
  - Soil structure & texture --> Gaps can lead water & contain air
  - Temperature fluctuation & water content --> Activity of organisms is influenced
  - pH level -->  Limits spreading of plants (Most plants have narrow tolerance for pH)
  - nutrients & mineral content --> plants are base of food web --> their nutrients are important
- 4 important gases of the air & their use
  - Oxygen --> kinda obious tbh (cell respiration uses it to create energy, also used for burning)
  - Nitrogen --> needed for protein & DNA, can be converted to ammonia
  - CO<sub>2</sub> --> required for photosynthesis
  - Water vapor --> important for water cycle, every living oranism needs it, influences weather
