# Organs of vascular plants
## Vegetative organs
```They work for the survival of the individual```
1. Root 
2. Shoot: (hajtás)
* * Stem
* * Root
## Reproductive organs
```Reproducttive organs work for the survival of the species```
1. Flowers
2. Seeds
3. Fruit

## Vegetative
### Root
Tasks: Anchoring the plant, absorbing water and dissolved minerals
* Roots create root systems
* * Taproot system (főgyökérzet)
* * thick primary root, secondary roots, thing capillary roots
* * Dicots have this
* Fibrous root system (mellékgyökérzet)
* * Many uniform fibrous roots, secondary and capillary roots
* * monocots have this
### Shoot
#### Stem (axis) with leaves (appendages)
* Tasks of stem:
* * Support leaves, flowers, fruits
* * Connects the root and leaves
* * Transports water, minerals, organic compounds throughout the plant
**2 types of plants based on stem:**
1. Wooden stem plants
* * Types:
* * * Tree: trunk + branched crown
* * * Shrub: Crown begins at ground level (no trunk)
* * * Palm trunk: ubranched trunk + leaves on top of tree
2. Herbaceous stem plants (lágyszrúak)
* * Dicots and monocots
* * **Annuals**: Grow and **die within a year**
* * **Biennuals**: Grows flowers in the **2nd year**
* * **Parennials**: Survive several winters, **grow flowers every year**
### **Leaves**
* Photosynthesis
* Gas exchange
* Evapotranspiration\
**Parts of leaves:**
1. blade - levéllemez
2. petiole - levélnyél
3. leaf base - levélalap
4. veins - levélerek (vascular tissue)\
**Types of leaves based on their blade**
1. Simple: 1 petiole supports 1 blade
2. Compound: 1 petiole and segmented blades = leaflets
* * Two subtypes
* 1.: Palmately compound
* 2.: pinnately compound
**Types of leaves based on leaf veins**
1. Netted (reticulated) veins: from the primary veins secondary veins diverge
2. Parallel veins (párhuzamos erezet): veins go in paral
