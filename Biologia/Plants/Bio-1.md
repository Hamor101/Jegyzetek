### Testing tools and methods

I can also create footnotes [^1]

[^1]: They are automatically put at the bottom of a page and serve as ways to add extra information

Math formulae are also quite easy to create:
$$
\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 180\deg\\
linebreak\space has \space been \space added

$$

*Code* can also be written and the syntax can be highlit, however it cannot be compiled or executed:

```C++
#include<iostream>

int main(){
    std::cout<<"Hello World";
    return 0;
}
```
<mark>Highlit text appears like this</mark>\
H<sub>2</sub>O \
**<dt>Term:</dt>**
<dd>Something which can be defined <dd>

I have also created a footnote code snippet [^2]

[^2]: works pretty well :)
