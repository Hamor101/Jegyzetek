# Biological levels of organisation
* The base of life is the cell
* In the case of **unicellular** organisms (e.g bacteria) the cell makes all the functions to stay alive
* In the case of **multicellular** organisms (fungi, plants, animals) cells have specific functions, roles. It's a complex organisation
## Levels of organisation under organism
1. **Cell:** Basic unit of structure and function
2. **Tissue:** Group of connected cells that have a similar function (e.g cardiac muscle)
3. **Organ:** Consists of **at least 2 types of tissues**
4. **Organ system:** a group of organs that work together to carry out a complex overall function (e.g cardiovascular system transportation of blood to carry O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, nutrients, waste, hormones)
## Levels of organisation above organism[^1]:
1. **Population:** Groups of individuals (**from the same species**) that live together to create reproduction communities
2. **Community:** **At least 2 populations** of different species that live in the same area (e.g forest)
3. **Biome:** sum of communities on a continental scale in connection with the climate
4. **Biosphere:** Global ecological system integrating all living beings
