# Cell structure and function
* Cells are the basic units of life
* Two main types:
* * **Prokaryotic:** No nucleus or cell organelles BUT they do have DNA
* * **Eukaryotic:** Nucleus and cell oranelles and DNA
## Cells
* Among eukarotic cells there are also a lot of differences, based on their nutrition, function as the part of a tissue

* Some cell organelles can only be found in plant cells

* Main parts of the eukaryotic cells:
1. Cell membrane
2. Cytoplasm
3. Nucleus
4. Organelles, mitochondrion, chloroplast
5. Endomembrane system

### Functions
1. **Cell membrane:**
* * Acts like a gate
* * Controls what can come in and go out the cell
* * Lipid bilayer with proteins
2. **Cytoplasm:**
* * gel-like structure
* * Main component is water
* * Contains salts, proteins, carbohydrates
3. **Nucleus:**
* * Contains DNA
* * Directs metabolism
* * Directs reproduction
4. **Cell organelles:**
* * Once they were prokaryotes, but were incorporated into the cell /w symbiosis
