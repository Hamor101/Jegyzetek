# Levels of organisation of plants
* First there were only **unicellular organisms**
* These organisms then started to **remain together** mainly after cell division, thus becoming **multicellular orgnaisms**
* There are two groups of plants:
* 1. Non-vascular plants without real tissues [^1]
* 2. Vascular plants with tissues and organs [^2]
[^1]: Hajtásos
[^2]: Nem hajtásos

## Non-vascular plants
* They help us understand the evoluton of plants, as they show the stages of development
### Organisation of nonvascular plants
1. **colonies**[^3] after cell division the cells remain together in a gel-like covering (for protection)
[^3]:sejttársulások
* * Cells with same shape
* * Cells of identical function
* * Cells live beside eachother
2. **Filamentous form** [^4]
[^4]: sejtfonalas szerveződés
* * Cell division happens in 1 direction, a filament is thus created
* * cells have partial specification (some for fixing the plant, some for photosynthesis, some for division)
3. Thalliform [^5]
[^5]: Teleptestű
* * cell division happens in 3 dimensions
* * cells have partial specialization
* * organ-like structures  [^6]
