# Phyla of algae
* Diverse group of plants with rudimentary levels of organization
* they live in waters, some in damp habitats
* nonvascular
### 1. Green algae
* **ancestors of vascular plants**
* They have clorophyl, which they use for **photosynthesis**
* All forms can be found among them
* Primarily found in **fresh waters**
* Only algae that can be found in damp habitats (outside of water)
* Accumulation of nutrients can cause overgrowth - called water bloom
* In aquatic habitats, they are the **base of the food web**, important in O<sub>2</sub> production
* Usage: food/water purification, production of biofuels
### 2. Brown algae
* **Only thalliform**
* **Cooler marine waters** near coasts
* Up to **20m of depth**
* **Brown pigment** as well as chlorophyl 
* High **Iodine** content
* Can be **up to 300 meters** long
* They create underwater forests - **important habitats** [^1]
[^1]: Also known as kelp
* Usage: food- animal food, manure, chemistry (because of Iodine and potassium content)
### 3. Red algae
* **Only thalliform**
* **warm** marine areas and **deeper waters**
* originated from **cyanobacteria**
* **red pigments** make them able to utilize **blue light** in deep waters
* Usage: edible algae, cosmetic industry, food industry (for gelling agent in ice cream and yoghurt)
