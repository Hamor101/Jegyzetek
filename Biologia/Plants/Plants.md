# Plants
Plants are multicellular autotrophs

### Mosses
* Non-vascular plants
* Thalliform, damp habitats
* Absorb water and inorganic compounds on their whole body surface
* Water content dependant on environment (drying and reviving)
* Gametes need help of water to meet (sexual reproduction)
* Important in soil formation
### Pteridophytes
* First terrestrial plants with tisues and organs (e.g leaves, stem, root)
* Vascular plants without flowers or seeds
* Sexual reproduction still depends on water, as their gametes need water to meet
* Their groups:
* * club mosses - korpafüvek
* * horsetails - zsúrlók
* * ferns - páfrányok
### Gymnosperms
* First terrestrial plants with water-independent sexual reproduction
* Inside the cones there are seeds which contain the baby plant after fertilization
* Mainly indeciduous[^1], they have pine-needles [^2]
[^1]: örökzöld
[^2]: tűlevelek
* They contain resin (helps them survive in cold, injuries)
* Pines - fenyőfélék
* Yews - tiszafélék
* Ginko biloba - páfrányfenyő
