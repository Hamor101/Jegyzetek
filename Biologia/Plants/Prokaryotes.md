# Prokaryotes' kingdom
## General
* **Flagellum[^1]/ Pili[^2]:** Movement
* **Cell wall / capsule:** Protection
* **Cytoplasm:** Gel-like structure rich in water, contains the enzymes of the bacteria
* **Ribosomes:** Responsible for protein synthesis
* **Plasmid:** Small part of DNA which can be exchanged between two bacteria
* **DNA[^3]:** Contains genetic information
[^1]: plural: flagella, HU: Ostor
[^2]: singular: pilus, HU: Csill√≥
[^3]: A.K.A: Nucleus
* They live in the air, water, soil, inside other organisms, hot springs
* Most abundant living beings on earth [^4]
[^4]: The reasons for this: diverse, metabolism, fast reproduction, good adaptation
* Mainly heterotrophs
* Most important decomposers in nature: they can convert organic compounds into inorganic compounds, that can be used by plants, only bacteria can digest cellulose (they live in symbiosis with herbivores)
## Grouping of bacteria:
 * **Parasitic bacteria:** cause illnesses, they use the substances of the host for their metabolism and reproduction
 * **Symbiont bacteria:** live together with other organisms which is beneficial for both
 * Cyanobacteria
 * * Autotrophic
 * * They started creating the oxygenic atmosphere
 * * Their colour is between blue and green
## Industrial usage of bacteria
1. **Food industry:** Fermentation of foods like yoghurt, sour cabbage, pickles
2. **Chemical industry:** Bacteria can produce certain agents of detergents for washing powders.
3. **Medicine:** Modified (GMO) bacteria produce vitams, antibiotics and several drugs
