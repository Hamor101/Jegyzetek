# Protists
## General
 * Proper nucleus and membrane-bound cell organelles
 * Mostly living in water, moist soil (there are also parasitic ones)
 * Asexual and sexual reproduction
## Groups
1. **Animal-like**
* * Heterotroph w/o cell wall
* * Only feeding through **oral groove**
* * 2 nuclei
* * **macronucleus:** directs the metabolism
* * **micronucleus:** for sexual reproduction
2. **Plant-like protists (=algae)**
* * Cellulose cell wall
* * Autotrophs
* * Cell organelles (chloroplasts)
* * They perform photosynthesis
* * Base of aquatic food web
3. **Euglenophytas**[^1]
[^1]: Ostoros moszatok
* * Flagellum
* * Mixotrophs[^2]
[^2]: Autotrophic in light, heterotrophic in darkness
* * Used for water purification
* * Their ancestors could be where plants and animals separated
* * Eye spot
4. **Unicellular fungi:**
* * Heterotrophs
* * Decomposers or parasites (no symbionts)
* * **Yeasts:** Decompose glucose w/o O<sub>2</sub> and produce alcohol + CO<sub>2<sub>[^3]
[^3]: This process is called fermentation
