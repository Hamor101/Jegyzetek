### Testing tools and diagnostic techniques

**Stereo microscope:**


* examined size: millimeter (10<sup>-3</sup>m)
* 2 tubes with ocular lenses which are near the eyes and objective lenses which are near the specimen
* sample can be seen in 3d
* magnification about 50x
* (e.g: skull of a mouse, moss, parts of insects)\

##
**Electron microscope:**

* size range: nanometer (10<sup>-9</sup>m)
* it uses a beam of electrons to generate an image (works in a vacuum and needs a fluorescent umbrella)
* high resolution
* magnification 100 000x
* (e.g.: viruses, molecules)

## Diganostic techniques

* Mainly used to detect diseases or dysfunctions

**X-rays:**
* examine the muscoloskeletal system (and lung)
* bones create shadows on the x-ray film\

**Ultrasound:**

* the tool sens vibrations through the tested area/organ and the reflected ultrasound creates the image
* soft tissues can be examined
  
**MRI:**

MRI = *Magnetic resonance imaging*
* high powered magnet that can show the organs and soft tissues

**CT:**

CT = *computed tomography*

* takes many images from several angles and the computer creates a very detailed image of the tested area
