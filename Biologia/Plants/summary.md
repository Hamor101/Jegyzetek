### Mosses
- Nonvascular
- thalliform
- absorb water / nutrients on their whole body
- can slow their metabolism
- need water for reproduction
- spores
- important for soil formation

- Problems of vascular plants when migrating to land:
    - Dessication, 
- task of meristematic tissue:
    - Only tissue which can divide and make permanent tissue
- Permanent tissues of plants
    - Ground
    - Dermal
    - Vascular
- 4 tasks of dermal tissue:
    - Protection from injury
    - Protection from dessication
    - Protects outer part of plant
    - Gas exchange / evapotranspiration
- How does stoma control evapotranspiration:
    - when there isn't enough water, the guard cells close the opening
    - when there is enough water, the guard cells swell and open
- 2 types of vascular tissue comparison:
    - Xylem, transports water and inorganic compounds one way
    - Oranic compounds from leaves to every part of the plant, two way
- Chlorenchyma:
    - Contains the chloroplasts
- 3 types of stored food in plants
    - Carbohydrates -- gabona
    - Fats/oils -- nuts
    - Proteins -- legumes
- vegetative organs:
    - root
    - shoot
    - stem
    - leaves
- Reproductive organs:
    - Flower
    - Seeds
    - Fruit
- 2 types of root sytems:
    - Taproot system : has one thick main root with secondary and capillary roots
    - Fibrous root system : uniformally thick roots  - no primary root
- Tasks of stem
    - Transporting nutrients/water
    - Supporting plant structure
    - Connects leaves with roots
- Tasks of leaves:
    - Photosynthesis
    - Gas exchange / evapotranspiration
- Tasks of flower:
    - sex organ of the plant
    - Attract pollinators
    - place of fertilization
    - It will produce the fruit
- fruit types
    - Fleshy fruits - high water content -- eg berries
    - Dry fruits - Fruit dries out -- legumes/acorn
- Thigns that can be controlled by enzymes:
    - Start of germination
    - Start of ripening
    - Growth
    - Leaf shedding
- Asexual reproduction of plants
    - Reproducing vegetative organs (e.g runner of strawberry)
- Place of fertilization
    - In the ovary
- What contains the egg
   - The ovule
- What contains the baby plant
    - The seed
- Requirements of germination
    - Water
    - oxygen
    - warmth
- Requirements of growing plants
    - Sunlight
    - Nutrients
    - Water
    - CO<sub>2</sub>
