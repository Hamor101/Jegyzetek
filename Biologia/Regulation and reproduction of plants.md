# Regulation and reproduction of plants
### Hormones
- Multicellular organisms' cells work together, but their work has to be synchronized
- Regulation is done by hormones
- Hormones are produced/secreted by cells and have an effect on the function of other cells
- Hormones are transported through vascular tissue
- They mainly have general effects
- They influence:
- - Growth
- - Flowering
- - Fruit ripening
- - Germination
- - Leaf shedding (Abscission)
- Auxin was the first plant hormone discovered
- Auxin has several roles:
- 1. Elongation of stem
- 2. Elongation of root
- 3. Growth in the direction of light
## Reproduction
### Asexual reproduction
- Vascular plants can reproduce with their **vegetative parts**
- There are also modified plants for reproduction:
-  - Runner of strawberries
-  - Tuber of potatoes
-  - Bulb of tulips
- Vegetative reproduction is used in argriculture and horticulture
- It is called vegetative propagation
### Sexual reproduction
- Meeting of gametes required
- Happens inside the flower and inside the ovary
- The pollen contains the sperm
- The pollen can get on the stigma with the help of air, water, or pollinators
- The **ovule**[^1] contains the egg
- Fertilized egg is called the zygote
- After cell divisions the zygote becomes the plant embryo and will be part of the seed
#### The seed
- Formed from the ovule after fertilization
- seed contains baby plant and stored food for germination
- Is in a dormant state until the proper conditions of germination
#### Ontogeny (= egyedfejlődés)
- The seed starts its germination in suitable conditions:
- - proper temperature
- - water
- - oxygen
- - hormones
- Before germination, water is absorbed, seed swells, mobilizes stored food
- Steps of germination:
- - 1. radicle (root) grows out in the direction of the soil and opens the seed coat
- - 2. cotyledons are pushed above the ground with the epicotyl (shoot), the plant is called sprout/plantlet(csíranövény)
- - 3. the primary leaves begin unfolding and the stem elongates, the plant can photosynthesize, so it is self supplying and called seedling (palánta)
- After germination, the plant can grow vegetative organs: root, stem, leaves
- For growing, the plant needs:
- 1. light
- 2. water
- 3. dissolved minerals
- 4. appropriate temperature
- To create reproductive organs, the vegetative organs have to be well developed
- Plants can be grouped based on the amount of light they need to grow reproductive organs:
- 1. Long-day plants: for flowering they need more than 12 hours of sunlight
- 2. Short-day plants: they need less than 12 hours of light/illumination
