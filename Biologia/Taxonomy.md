# Taxonomy of the living world
Organisms have a place in the kingdoms of hte living world\
Their place is based on their level of organisation, source of carbon, and source of energy

5 kingdoms: 
* Prokaryotes
* Protists (unicellular eukaryotes)
* Fungi
* Plants
* Animals
### Sources of carbon:
1. CO<sub>2</sub> from the environment, these organisms are the autotrophs
* * from inorganic carbon- CO<sub>2</sub> they make organic carbon (glucose)
2. Organic carbon from other organisms - called heterotrophs
* * f
### Source of energy:
1. Sunlight (in the case of autotrophs)
* * They can convert the energy of the sun into organic compounds' bonds, the process is called **photosynthesis**
2. Chemical energy of organic compounds (e.g glucose)
* * Every organism gets energy from this way by breaking down organic molecules (e.g glucose into smaller molecule, then into inorganic compounds (e.g CO<sub>2</sub>))
