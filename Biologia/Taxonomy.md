# Taxonomy of the living world
Organisms have a place in the kingdoms of hte living world\
Their place is based on their level of organisation, source of carbon, and source of energy

5 kingdoms: 
* Prokaryotes
* Protists (unicellular eukaryotes)
* Fungi
* Plants
* Animals
### Sources of carbon:
1. CO<sub>2</sub> from the environment, these organisms are the autotrophs
* * from inorganic carbon- CO<sub>2</sub> they make organic carbon (glucose)
2. Organic carbon from other organisms - called heterotrophs
### Source of energy:
1. Sunlight (in the case of autotrophs)
* * They can convert the energy of the sun into organic compounds' bonds, the process is called **photosynthesis**
2. Chemical energy of organic compounds (e.g glucose)
* * Every organism gets energy this way by breaking down organic molecules (e.g glucose into smaller molecules, then into inorganic compounds (e.g CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O))
## Taxonomy
Characterization of the living world's kingdoms:
1. **Prokaryotes:**
* * Unicellular
* * Ancestors of all livng organisms
* * They are bacteria
* * No nucleus but have DNA
* * Can reproduce[^1]
* * Some of them are autotrophs, others are heterotrophs[^2]
[^1]: Sexually and/or asexually
[^2]: Heterotrophs cause illness
2. **Protists:**
* * Unicellular eukaryotes
* * They have a nucleus
* * They have cell organelles (e.g mitochondria)
* * Autotrophs, heterotrophs and mixotrophs[^3]
3. **Fungi:**
* * Multicellular eukaryotes
* * They have cell walls
* * Heterotrophs
4. **Plants:**
* * Multicellular eukaryotes
* * They have cell walls
* * They can photosynthesise
* * Autotrophs: CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, Light are used to create energy
5. **Animals:**
* * Multicellular eukaryotes
* * **No cell wall** (only cell membrane)
* * Heterotrophs
## Prokaryotes' kingdom
* Flagellum[^4]/ Pili[^5]: Movement
* Cell wall / capsule: Protection
* Cytoplasm: Gel-like structure rich in water, contains the enzymes of the bacteria
* Ribosomes: Responsible for protein synthesis
* Plasmid: Small part of DNA which can be exchanged between two bacteria
* DNA[^6]: Contains genetic information
[^3]: In darkness, they are heterotrophs, in light they are autotrophs
[^4]: plural: flagella, HU: Ostor
[^5]: singular: pilus, HU: Csill√≥
[^6]: A.K.A: Nucleus
