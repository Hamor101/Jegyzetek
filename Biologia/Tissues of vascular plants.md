# Tissues of vascular plants

Tissue: ``` Collection of similar cells with the same origin and specific function```

## Types
### Meristematic tissue:
* Cells with the abilitiy to divide
* Production of other tissue types
### Permanent tissue
Cells which have lost the ability to divide
 * 3 main types:
 * * dermal
 * * vascular
 * * ground
### Dermal
* External parts of plants
* protects from desiccation, pathogens
* does gas exchange

**2 types:**
* epidermis
* periderm

**Stoma**
* Controls the **gas exchange** and **evapotransporation**
* Uses water to open and close

**Root cells**
* Epidermis cells with **root hair**
* root hair increases surface area for **water intake**

**Periderm** [^1]
[^1]: bark
* covers older stem, trunk of trees
* protects from injuries, desiccation, pathogens
### Vascular tissue
2 ways of transport with 2 kinds of vascular tissues

1. **Xylem**[^2]: transports inorganic nutrients and water from **roots to leaves**, in **only one direction**
[^2]: farész
2. **Phloem**[^3]: **organic compounds** from leaves to every part, **2 way transport**
[^3]: háncsrész

### Ground tissues
* Many kinds
* Diverse cell types
* Grouped based on function

**Types:** \
**1. Parenchyma: filler tissue in soft parts of plants**
* * Chlorenchyma[^4]: Cells with several chloroplasts, mainly in leaves
[^4]: táplálékkészító alapszövet
* * Parenchyma tissue for storage[^5]: Cells have several vacoules to **store food/water**
* * * Stored food types can be:
* * * * **Carbohydrates**[^6] e.g starch in rice, potato, corn
* * * * **Oil**:  e.g walnut, almond
* * * * **Protein** e.g soybean, pea, lentil
* * **Plant parts** having **parenchyma** tissue for storage:
* * * **Roots** (e.g carrot)
* * * **Tubers** (e.g potato)
* * * **Bulb** (e.g onion)
* * * **Cotyledon**[^7] (e.g peanut)
[^6]: szénhidrát
[^5]: raktározó alapszövet
[^7]: sziklevél
* * Stored water is in vacoules as well in **succulents**:
* * * **stem** (cacti)
* * * **leaves** (stonecrops)

**2. Collenchyma**
* strengthening tissue of **young plant parts**
* living cells with **thickened cell wall**
* **high cellulose** content

**1. Sclerenchyma:**
* strengthening tissue of **older plant parts / fruits**
* **dead cells** with thick cell wall made of **cellulose and lignin**
