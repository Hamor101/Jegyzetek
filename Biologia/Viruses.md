# Viruses
* No life phenomena $\rArr$ not living-beings
* No regulation or metabolism
* Cannot reproduce w/o host cell
* *"Non-living particles"*
### Structure
* 3 parts
* * Nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) - this **directs host cells** to produce new viruses
* * Capsid - protein coat to **protect the nucleic acid**
* * envelope (not always present) - created from the **membrane of the host cell** as a "disguise"
### Functioning
* After infection, the viruses direct the host cells to replicate the virus
* The host cell assembles the viruses
* After this, the host cell generally dies
#
* Viruses are often **host-specific** (e.g some will only infect humans, but not cats)
* Of controversial origin (they cannot have been the first living things, as they need already livin hosts)
* They can be grouped according to host cells:
* * Bacteriophages (their host cells are bacteria)
* * Plant viruses (e.g mosaic disease on tobacco plant)
* * Animal viruses (e.g parvovirus)
* * Human viruses (e.g rhinovirus (causing the common cold), HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), influenza virus, measles)
