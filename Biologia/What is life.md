# What is life? (baby don't hurt me)

### Requirements of life:
* **water** (liquid): life was born in water, it is a *life agent* [^1] , component of cells, reactant of chemical processes
[^1]: életközeg
* **oxygen:** is needed for getting energy from organic compounds, it is needed for biological oxidation (A.K.A: cell respiration)
* **earth's crust:** for terrestrial living beings, nutrient cycles (biogeochemical cycling)
* **gravitation:** keeps the atmosphere around the earth for the biosphere
* **appropriate distance from the sun:** temperature for living beings is crucial

### What is life?
Difference between living organisms and inanimate objects:
* living organisms show life phenomena (reproduction, metabolism, )\
### **life phenomena:**
* **metabolism:** intake of nutrients, digestion, breathing, removal of waste products (faeces, urine, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O)
* **Regulation:** detecting and **responding to changes in environment** to stay alive/create offspring (e.g: when it's hot, humans sweat) [^2]
[^2]: With more evolution, regulation becomes more complex
* **Reproduction:** living organisms can pass their characteristics onto their offspring
### Reproduction
* **Two types of reproduction:**
* Asexual: offspring are clones (1 parent) [^3]
* Sexual: meeting of gametes (eggs and sperms) [^4]\
&ensp;&ensp;1. External fertilization: in the environment (e.g fish,frogs)\
&ensp;&ensp;2. Internal fertilization: gametes meet inside the body of the female (e.g crocodiles, birds, mammals)
[^3]: Asexual reproduction is not good for evolution as it essentially creates as clone of the parent
[^4]: Sexual reproduction is good for evolution as new characteristics can be created
