# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Gene interaction and sex linked inheritance
- Genes can interact with eachother
- One gene can mask or hide expression of another
- These are called epistatic genes/alleles
- Interaction is called epistasis
- E.g for recessive epistasis:
  - Inheritance of horses coat colour and labrador retrievers' fur colour

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Labrador retriever's fur colour
- relationship between 2 genes with dominant-recessive iheritance
- dominant B --> black colour
- recessive b --> brown colour
- dominant E --> no impact on fur colour
- recessive e --> blocks pigment deposition
