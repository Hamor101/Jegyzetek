Genetics: Study of heredity, patterns of inheritance of traits / biological characteristics
```
- Traits of an individual are coded in its `DNA`, in its `genes`[^1]
- the DNA is passed onto the offspring through reproduction 
- Protein synthesis is the decoding process of information
## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Terms
### <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Genome:
- full genetic complement of a `species` (e.g: human genome)
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Genotype:
- full genetic complement of an `individual` (all of its genes)
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Phenotype:
- the detectable expression of a genotpe, traits that can be seen (e.g eye color)
### <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Allele:
- Different `gene variations` for a trait
- Can have only `two for one trait`
- inherited from parents (1 from mother, 1 from father)

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Alleles
- According to alleles, individuals can be:
  - `Homozygotes`: Same alleles for a given trait (blue eye dad, blue eye mom)
  - `Heterozygotes`: Different alleles for a given trait (blue eye, green eye)
- Alleles can be stronger or weaker:
  - `Dominant` allele: Strong, masks other alleles
  - `Recessive` allele: weak, masked by dominant alleles

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Individualism
- Based on several kinds of alleles and the large number of genes, there couldn't be individuals with identical genotypes
## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Genetic diversity
- Survival of a species depends on its genetic diversity
  - genetic diversity is the basic of the adaptation to the changes of the environment
  - species with few genetic varieties are on the brink of extinction
