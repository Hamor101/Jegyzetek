# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Mendelian genetics
- `Gregor Mendel`: Father of genetics
  - Austrian monk
  - Did experiments with `pea plants`
  - He examined dominant-recessive inheritance
  - Trait of `dominant allele` is `always expressed` in the case of `heterozygous plants`, `recessive alleles`' trait can be seen in the phenotype `only in homozygous plants`
  - Results of plant crossbreeding were illustrated with `Punnett square`
  - dominant green pod (GG) X recessive yellow pod (gg)
  - first generation (F1): 4 heterozygous (Gg) green pod plants

## Laws of genetics
`I. Uniformity principle:` - Homozygous parents' first generation offspring are the same, both in terms of geno- and phenotype\
`II. Segregation principle:` - Parental traits don't blend, they segregate and can be seen in the second generation\
`III. Independent assortment principle:` - Different pairs of alleles are passed to offspring independently of each other, so new combinations of alleles appear, different from the parents in the 2nd generation
