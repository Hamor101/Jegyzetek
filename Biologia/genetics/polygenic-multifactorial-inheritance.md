# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Polygenic/Multifactorial inheritance
- Qualitative traits <--> Quantitative traits
- Polygenic inheritance is complex
- Same genes can influence more traits
- Can be characterised with:
  - Dimensions: Height, weight
  - Numbers: yield of eggs of chickens
  - continous gradient: seed coat color of corn
- Trait distribution of polygnic traits:
  - Shown with Gaussian distribution
## Coat color of wheat
- 3 genes make reddish pigment
  - additive effects
  - All of them have dominant/recessive alleles
- A spectrum of phenotypes is produced

## Quantitative traits
- Dependent on environmental factors as well as genetics
- Influenced by `more than 2 genes`
