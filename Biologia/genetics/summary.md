# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Summary

- Difference between dominant and recessive:
    - Dominant allele is always expressed in the phenotype
    - Recessive allele is only expressed if a dominant allele for the same trait is not present

- Mendel's first law:
  - First generation homozygous parents' offspring are same phenotype

- Codominant inheritance:
  - 2 dominant alleles, both expressed in the heterozygous form

- Intermediate inheritance
  -  e

- Why can males inherited diseases on the X chromosome more often?
  - Because they have only one, so unlike females, it cannot be overriden by the healthy x chromosome

- background of hemophilia:
  - One of the blood-clotting factors is missing
  - Blood cannot coagulate
  - Inherited on the `X chromosome`
  - Male hemophiliac: X<sup>h</sup>Y
  - Carrier (healthy) Female: X<sup>h</sup>Y

- Chance of having hemophiliac child given certain parents (idk bro 50/50)

- Chose 1 diseas with an extra sex chromosome (triple X, Klinefelter syndrome, Jacobson syndrome)
  - Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)
    - Taller w/ long limbs
    - Low testosterone --> Abnormal development of testes & penis --> Infertility
    - Delayed development & learning difficulties
  - Jacobson Syndrome (XYY)
    - Higher testosterone --> More aggressive behaviour
    - Often undiagnosed
    - Taller than average
    - NOT infertile

- Epistasis
    - 2nd gene can influence the expression of the first gene
    - Labrador retrievers' fur color
- Sex-linked inheritance in cats

- What is albinism?
  - Background:
    - Enzyme difficulties --> Missing melanin pigment
  - Affects:
    - Hair/eye/Skin color
  - Can be partial
  - Inherited recessively on autosomal chromosomes

- Lactose intolerance
  - Missing lactase enzyme
  - Inability to digest lactose --> Lactose will be fermented in the gut --> Gas production --> Abdominal problems & diarrhea

- Color vision deficiency
  - Background:
    - Inherited on the X chromosome
    - Missing 1 or more pigment from eye cones
- Down syndrome
  - Missing fragment from 21st chromosome
  - Causes:
    - Heart problems
    - Mental difficulties
- Polygenic traits:
  - Influenced by more than 2 genes & environment (e.g height)
  -
