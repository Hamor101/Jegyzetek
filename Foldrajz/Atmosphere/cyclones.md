```
Circular systems of low atmospheric pressures in which the pressure gradient is steep
```

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Cyclones
- 2 Types:
  - Temperate belt cyclone (extratropical cyclone)
  - Tropical cyclone (hurricanes/typhoon)

### Temperate belt cyclones
- `Northern hemisphere` --> Anticlockwise motion
- `Southern hemisphere` --> Clockwise motion
- `Process:`
  - Low pressure zone surrounded by high pressures on all sides
  - Inward wind
  - Coriolis force deflects wind --> whirling movement ðŸŒ€
  - In the middle, the wind is deflected upward
  - Wind rises --> Air cools rapidly --> water precipitates --> cloud formation & rain
- Reasons for development:
  - Meeting of easterly and westerly winds
  - Jet streams' whirling structures can break off and help with cyclone development

### Tropical belt cyclones & tornadoes
- Similar to temperate belt cyclones, `except stronger`
- `Hurricanes & Typhoons` belong here

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Anticyclones
- `Northern hemisphere` --> Clockwise motion
- `Southern hemisphere` --> Anticlockwise motion
- Static systems
- `Process:`
  - High pressure area surrounded by low pressures
  - Outward wind
  - Coriolis force deflects wind --> whirling movement ðŸŒ€
  - As it moves out, wind is deflected downwards
  - Downwards movin air --> dry air --> clear skies --> no precipitation
