```
Circular systems of low atmospheric pressures in which the pressure gradient is steep
```

## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Cyclones
- 2 Types:
  - Temperate belt cyclone (extratropical cyclone)
  - Tropical cyclone (hurricanes/typhoon)

### Temperate belt cyclones
- `Northern hemisphere` --> Anticlockwise motion
- `Southern hemisphere` --> Clockwise motion
- `Process:`
  - Low pressure zone surrounded by high pressures on all sides
  - Inward wind
  - Coriolis force deflects wind --> whirling movement ðŸŒ€
  - In the middle, the wind is deflected upward
  - Wind rises --> Air cools rapidly --> water precipitates --> cloud formation & rain
- Reasons for development:
  - Meeting of easterly and westerly winds
  - Jet streams' whirling structures can break off and help with cyclone development

### Tropical belt cyclones & tornadoes
- Similar to temperate belt cyclones, `except stronger`
- `Hurricanes & Typhoons` belong here
- Hurricanes
  - Atlantic ocean --> Caribbean region
  - Name comes from local language of caribbean (named after a storm god)
- Typhoon
  - Eastern Pacific ocean --> Southeast Asia
- `Common features`
  - Large, whirling system of clouds (visible from same)
  - Rougly the same diameter as Temperate cyclones (300 - 500km)
  - Anticlockwise
  - Extremely strong wind (150 - 200 kph)
  - Strong rainfall (due to extremely large pressure gradient)
  - Generates large seawaves
  - In the middle --> Called 'the eye' (10 - 20 km)
    - Less rain
    - Less wind
    - Clear skies
  - Predictable
- `Conditions`
  - Warm seawater (26-27 Â°C)
  - 5Â° - 15Â° North or South longitude
- `Tornadoes`
  - Typical in the temperate belt
  - Supercell
  - Extremely low pressure
  - Wind speed: 300-800 kph
  - March-November
## <span style="color:#fabd2f">Anticyclones
- `Northern hemisphere` --> Clockwise motion
- `Southern hemisphere` --> Anticlockwise motion
- Static systems
- `Process:`
  - High pressure area surrounded by low pressures
  - Outward wind
  - Coriolis force deflects wind --> whirling movement ðŸŒ€
  - As it moves out, wind is deflected downwards
  - Downwards moving air --> dry air --> clear skies --> no precipitation
