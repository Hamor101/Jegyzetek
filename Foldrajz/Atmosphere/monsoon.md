```
A monsoon is a wind system which changes its direction seasonally
```
- Change in wind direction () should be a MINIMUM of 120°
- Two types of monsoons
  - Monsoon-like phenomena in the temperate belt (mérsékelt övi monszun) -- Typical in East Asia
  - Tropical (real) monsoon  -- Typical in South Asia

## Monsoon-like phenomena in the temperate belt monsoons
- Large landmass next to a large body of water (e.g east asia)
- During `summer:`
  - Continent heats up faster than the water (low air pressure on land)
  - Ocean is cold by comparison (high air pressure on water)
  - Result: Easterly wind (brings precipitation) --> good for rice production
  - 
- During `winter:`
  - High air pressure develops above land
  - Low air pressure develops above water
  - Opposite situation as summer --> opposite wind direction

## Tropical (aka real) monsoon
- Thermal equator -- Imaginary line connecting the hottest temperatures (and therefore lowest pressures) of Earth
- In summer:
  - Trade winds blow towards low pressure zones, which are in the North --> Southeasterly winds
- In winter
  - Trade winds blow towards low pressure zones, which are in the South --> Northwesterly winds
