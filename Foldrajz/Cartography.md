# Cartography
## What is a map?
*```A map is a graphic representation, drawn to scale and usually on a flat surface, of features of an area of the Earth (or of any other celestial body).```*
## Parts of a map
A proper map includes:
* A compass rose [^1]
* Grid
* The scale
* Labels and symbols
* Title
* Legend
### The scale
  *Used to represent **the relationship between distances** on the map and in real life*
  * Large scale : $\space\space1:500$
  * Medium scale : $1: 10\space000$
  * Small scale : $\space\space1: 1\space000\space000$
#
$47\space000 cm = 0.47km$<br>
$321\space400cm = 3.214km$<br>
$4\space000\space000cm = 4km$
### Task: Calculate distance from casablanca to Cairo\
Ratio sccale is 1:37 000 000\
Distance on map is 10.2cm\
$10.2 *37\space000\space000 = 377\space400\space000cm$\
**Casablanca is 377 400 000cm from Cairo**\
$377\space400\space000 / 100\space000 = 3774km$\
**Answer: The distance between Casablanca and Cairo is 3774km**
## Types of maps
Some types of map:
* Political maps - **Showing country borders and major cities**
* Topographic maps (AKA relief maps) - **Showing physical features of the Earth**
* Thematic maps - **Focus on a specific topic or theme (e.g: precipitation, climate, natural resources, land use, population)**
### Representing relief
* Contour lines are imaginary lines connecting points having same elevation above (or below) mean sea level. They are usually drawn in brown
* Layer coloring assigns certain colors to different heights
* Relief shading
* * Artificial lighting from the top-left of the map
* * Slope is darkened according to steepness
## Map projection
* The Earth is a sphere (3d)
* Maps are flat (not 3d)
* It's not possible to perfectly lay the Earth out onto a plane, so different projections are used
* Cylindrical projection: most commonly seen, less distortion around Equator
* Conic projection: least distortion around tropics of Cancer and Capricorn
[^1]: Maps are usually oriented North
