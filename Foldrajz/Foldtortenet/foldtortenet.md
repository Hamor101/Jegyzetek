# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Earth's history
- Age of Earth: `4.6 Billion yrs` (=4600 m.y)
- Divided into four `large eras`:
  - [Precambrian era](#precambrian-era) -- Ősidő
  - [Paleozoic era](#paleozoic-era) -- Óidő
  - [Mesozoic era](#mesozoic-era) -- Középidő
  - [Cenozoic era](#cenozoic-era) -- Újidő


# <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Methods of dating
- Two kinds of dating:
  - Relative dating
  - Absolute dating (aka radiometric dating)
### Relative dating (sweet home alabama)
- Born in the `early 19th century`:
  - Birth of `geology`
  - Birth of `paleontology`
    - Study of `fossils`[^1]
- Relative dating can determine the age of a rock relative to another
- `3 main rules:`
  - The deeper the rock is, the older it is
  - Rock layers containing similar fossils are about the same age
  - The younger the rock, the more developed to fossils in it

[^1]: Remain or impression of any formerly living animal or plant preserved by natural causes in rocks

### Absolute dating
- Based on `decay` of `radioactive isotopes`
- When using `carbon-14`:
  - <sup>14</sup>C --> <sup>14</sup>N
  - The half-life of <sup>14</sup>C: $\lambda = \plusmn ­5700 yrs$
- When using Uranium-235:
  - <sup>235</sup>U --> <sup>207</sup>Pb
  - Half life: $\lambda = 71\space000\space000yrs$

# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Precambrian era
### `4600-542 m.y.a`
- Little is known about this era
- Four large `mountain formations`:
  - They became `ancient shields/massifs`
- `Reducing` atmosphere:
  - No oxygen
  - CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S were common
- `First lifeforms` appeared at this time ~ 2.5 b.y.a
  - Blue bacteria -- `Cyanobacteria`
    - Autotrophic, unicellular prokaryotes

# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Paleozoic era
### `542-250 m.y.a`
- 2 major mountain formations (orogenesis)
## Cambrian
- Many new invertebrates (Porifera, cnidarians, worms, echinoderms) --> Cambrian explosion
- Trilobites appeared
## Ordovician
- First vertebrates (armoured fish)
- Low atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> --> No plants / land animals
### Silurian
- First terrestrial animals
  - Scorpion-like arthropods
- First terrestrial plants
  - fern-like plants (in damp habitats close to water)

# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Mesozoic era
- 3 Periods:
  - Triassic
  - Jurassic
  - Cretaceous
- Pangea was split in two by thetys (into Laurasia and Gondwana)
## <span style= "color:#fabd2f">Triassic
- reptiles, dinosaurs became common
- First `birds` and `mammals`
### <span style= "color:#fabd2f">Solnhofen fossils
- First bird fossil: `Archeopteryx`
- Firt mammal:
  - Small
  - Shrew-like
  - Tree-dweling
  - Insectivore
#
- Ammonites appeared
### <span style= "color:#fabd2f">First flowering plants
  - Similar to pines
  - `Seeds` appeared with them

# <span style= "color:#fabd2f">Cretaceous period
- Angiosperms, modern plants appeared
### <span style= "color:#fabd2f">2nd great extinction at the end (The exctinction of dinosaurs)
  - As a result of meteorite impact, ash flew into the atmosphere
  - The ash blocked out the sun --> Drastic cooling
  - Dinosaurs were exothermic --> they died due to the cold


# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Cenozoic era
### `65 m.y.a -- now`
- Age of birds and mammals
- 2 periods
  - `Tertiary` --> Harmadidőszak (65-2.5 m.y.a)
  - `Quaternary` --> Negyedidőszak (2.5 m.y.a -- now)
- Mammals, birds increased in `numbers`, `Number of species`
- Mammals, birds increased in `size`
- Grassland appeared


# <span style="color:#fabd2f">The  large structured units of continents
## I. Ancient shields / Ancient massifs
- Large, stable blocks of the Earth's crust
- Original cores of continents
- Precambrian rocks
- Unaffected by mountain formations over large periods of time
- These are:
  - Baltic
  - Angara
  - Chinese
  - Deccan
  - Australian
  - African
  - Arabian
  - Antarctic
  - Brazil
- 2 types of shield:
  - Bare
  - Covered
## II. Block mountains
- Height `< 2000m`
- `Smooth`, `rounded` landforms
- `Medium` mountains
### Caledonian mountain system (members)
- Scandinavian Mt.
- Scotland
- Northern part of irish island
- Eastern greenland
- Northern Appalachian Mt.
### Variscan Mountain System (members)
- Pennine (England)
- Massif central (Fr.)
- German medium Mt.
  - Black forest
  - Harz
