# History of modern astronomy
## Roots
* Stone / bronze age: people realized celestial bodies have cyclic motions
* Monuments of astronomical significance
* Likely used as calendars or eclipse predictors
### Stonehenge
* In alignment with different sunset/sunrise locations
* probably used as a calendar
### Ancient Greek Astronomers
* Aristotle said the universe can be divided into two:
* * Imperfect earth
* * Perfect heavens (described by spheres)
* Ancient greek models were based on geocentrism
### Ptolemaic system
* Also geocentric model
* Used epicycles
### Eratosthenes
* Calculated the earth's radius
### Copernican revolution
* Discovered the heliocentric model of the solar system
* His theory was proven by Galileo
### Galileo Galilei
* Galileo used observation-based science
* Used a telescope
* Observed the sky every night, and made meticulous records
* His major discoveries include:
* * **Moons of Jupiter**
* * Surface structures on the surface of the moon (also first approximates for heights of lunar mountains)
* * **Discovered sun spots** - Disproving the idea that the sun was perfect
* * **Phases of Venus** - Proving that venus orbits the Sun
### Johannes Kepler
* Used the precise observational tables of Tycho Brahe to study planetary motions mathematically
* * Discovered elliptic orbits - further disproving the perfection of the universe
* * Discovered that planets don't move uniformally - They have different orbital velocities

### Mercury
Fun facts:
1. smallest planet in the solar system
2. Fastest orbit - one year is 88 days
3. hottest  temp at day 430, coldest at night: -180
4. very long day, very short year -> one day is longer than one year
5. Big aah core
### Venus
Fun facts:
1. Most massive atmosphere amongst all the terrestrial planet
2. Hotter than mercury, despite being further
3. No moons
4. One cloud is one million tons
5. Sulfuric acid rain
6. One year is 255 earth days

### Mars
1. 5million cubic cm of water
2. Tallet mountain 21900m
3. 95% co2
4. 1 mars year is almost two earth years
5. Slower than earth's rotation
6. Dust storms every two years (> 100 mph)
