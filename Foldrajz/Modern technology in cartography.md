# Modern technology in cartography
## Remote sensing
```Definition: the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emmitted radiation at a distance```
### Orthophoto
*From greek, ortho means directly above*\
Images of the earth from above at 90$\degree$
### Satellite image
Images of earth from satellites orbiting above the earth
Can be used for military of civillian purposes among others
### Different types of spacecraft
* Mono-spectral: Observing a single band of electromagnetic spectrum (e.g: UV, visible, IR)
* Multi-spectral: Observing 3-10 bands of wavelengths
* Hyperspectral: Oserving 10-100 bands of wavelengths
## Global Positioning System
* Used for determining position
* 24-30 satellites
* LEO - Low Earth Orbit
*  * Densely populated
*  * Lots of scientific satellites
*  * Low latency
*  * Requires regular course correction
*  * Telecommunication
* MEO - Medium Earth Orbit
*  * Satellite shielding is required due to radiation
*  * GPS, military, surveilance
* GEO - Geostationary Earth Orbit
*  * 3 satellites can cover the entire earth
