# <p>Geo | Orientation in space and time</p>

### <p>Absolute and relative relief</p>
* **Relief:** height
* **Relative relief**: relief as compared to something else
* **Absolute relief**: relief compared to the mean sea level

### <p>Absolute and relative location</p>
* **Relative location:** location as compared to other countries/geographical formations
* **Absolute location:** location as shown by coordinates
#
**Horizon**: [^1]
* The line at which the sky and earth's surface appear to meet
  [^1]: Other word for it in hungarian: látóhatár
### <p>Orientation on the horizontal plane</p>
 * *Cardinal directions - Égtájak*
 * Degrees can also be used for more specific directions
 * Geographical grid system
### <p>Latitude</p>
 * latitude: vertical deviation from the equator in degrees
 * Named latitudes: Equator ($0\degree$), tropic of Capricorn ($23\degree 26' 22"S$), tropic of Cancer ($23\degree 26' 22" N$)
* At points where the latitude is greater than the tropics of caner and capricorn, there are no points in time at which the sun hits the earth's surface at $90\degree$
### <p>Longitude</p>
 * Longitude: horizontal deviation from Greenwich in degrees
 * there are 360 longitudes, but only 180 are used, along with whether the deviation from Greenwich is westerly or easterly (e.g: $135\degree W \not ={135\degree E}$)
##  <p>How do we measure time?</p>
* True solar time (slightly more than 24 hours)
* Mean solar time (exactly 24 hours) [^2]
[^2]: The reason for the difference between true solar time and mean solar time is the fact that when earth is at its *apohelion*, its rotation slows down slightly, making a day around 16 minutes longer
* Standard time: Earth is divided into timezones for ease of communication
* Local time: every point on earth has a local time
* Greenwich mean time (GMT) / Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) both refer to the time in Greenwich
