# Structure of the Earth
* Knowledge about the sturcture of Earth is from **indirect evidence**
* Some evidence comes from **boreholes**, some come from **seismic waves**
* Data is gathered about the speed  of the waves
## Temperature
* Geothermic gradient: 3°/100 meters[^1]
[^1]: Every hundred meters, temperature increases by 3 degrees celsius
* Core temperature:5-6000°


## Structure
* Spherical --> Gömbhélyakra tagolt
* Caused by rotation and gravity
* Different ways to distinguish layers:
* * Chemical composition:
* * * Crust, Mantle, Core
* * By rigid or plastic character
* * * Lithosphere, Astenosphere, Mezosphere, Outer core, Inner core
* Moho(rovicic) discontinuity

## The crust
* Outermost layer
1. Continental crust: Dry land () 
* * Much thicker
* * 40-70 km thick
* * Mostly granite
* * Density: 2.7 g/cm<sup>3</sup>
2. Oceanic crust:
* * Thinner
* * 5-10 km thick
* * Mostly Basalt
* * Density: 3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>

## The mantle
* Mostly made of silicates, iron, mangesium
* Top: Rigid [^2]
[^2]: Part of the **Lithosphere** along **with the crust**
* Middle: Plastic [^3]
[^3]: Makes up the **Astenosphere**
* Low: Rigid [^4]
[^4]: Makes up the **Mesosphere**

## The Core
* **Plastic outer core:**
* * Molten **iron and nickel**
* * **2900 - 5100** km deep
* **Solid inner core:**
* * **5100 - 6371** km deep
* * Iron, nickel, sulfur

## Earth's magnetism
* North pole: Positive
* South pole: Negative
* Magnetic declination
* THe earth's poles flip over long periods of time

## Continental drift
* Theory of A. Wegener 1912
* Continents are always in motion
* Based on the facts:
* * The outline of the continents fit together
* * Geoglogical evidence
* Theory was rejected back then
* * Mechanism of the motion wasn't explained

### Plate tectonics theory
* In the 1960s the theory was revived
* Discovered mid-oceanic ridges
* Main statements
* * The lithosphere is ~100km thick
* * * It forms seven main, and several smaller plates:
* * * * North American plate
* * * * South American plate
* * * * African plate
* * * * Eurasian plate
* * * * Antarctic plate
* * * * Pacific plate
* * * * Australian plate
* * Plates are in motion due to **convection** currents
* * Based on motion, differnet boundary types can be established

### Motion of plates
|Boundary type|Movement|Volcanoes?|Earthquakes?|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Constructive / divergent|Away from eachother|$\checkmark$|$\checkmark$|
|Destructive / convergent:  continental - oceanic|Towards eachother|$\checkmark$|$\checkmark$|
|Destructive / convergent: continental - continental|Towards eachother, creating mountains|$\empty$|$\checkmark$|
|Conservative|Side-by-side, either in opposite directions or the same dirrection but with different speeds|$\empty$|$\checkmark$|

## Divergent boundaries
- Occur in areas of seafloor spreading
- Upwelling material forms new seafloor
- shallow-focus earthquakes

## Convergent boundaries
- Occur in areas of crustal subduction\
``` Subduction: the process when lithospheric plates meet, and one descends beneath another and dives downward into the mantle. The area is a subduction zone```
- 3 types:
- a) continental and oceanic
- b) oceanic and oceanic
- c) continental and continental
