# Structure of the Earth
* Knowledge about the sturcture of Earth is from **indirect evidence**
* Some evidence comes from **boreholes**, some come from **seismic waves**
* Data is gathered about the speed  of the waves
## Temperature
* Geothermic gradient: 3$\degree$/100 meters[^1]
[^1] Every hundred meters, temperature increases by 3 degrees celsius
* Core temperature: <p style="font-family:'Garamdond'">5-6000$\degree$</p>
## Structure
* Spherical --> Gömbhélyakra tagolt
* Caused by rotation and gravity
* Different ways to distinguish layers:
* * Chemical composition:
* * * Crust, Mantle, Core
* * By rigid or plastic character
* * * Lithosphere, Astenosphere, Mezosphere, Outer core, Inner core
* Moho(rovicic) discontinuity
