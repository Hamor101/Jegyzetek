# Volcanoes
## `What are volcanoes?`
- **Circular / linear opening** in the earth
- Also a landform, often a mountain
    - Built from **multiple eruptions**
- Eruptions can be **explosive, effusive or both**

## `Shield volcanoes`
- **Effusive** eruptions
- **Broad**, Gently sloping
    - **Fluid** lava spreads out over a larger area
- E.g: Mauna Loa, Hawaii
## `Statovolcanoes`
- **Explosive and effusive**
- **Viscous** lava and pyroclasts[^1]
- **Steep**, often symmetrical
- E.g: Mount St. Helens

[^1]: fragments ejected during explosive eruption


### Questions for Mount St. Helens eruption:
1. What mountain range is Mount St. Helens a part of? :: `Cascades`
2. What started the eruption? :: `Pressure buildup / Earthquake`
3. What kind of eruption happened? :: `Lateral`
4. What is lahar? :: `Slurry of meltwater mixing with rock and debris`
5. What is in the cloud above the volcano? :: `Ash/Rocks/Steam`

## `Caldera`
- Forms from volcanoes:
  - Via **explosive eruption**
  - **Empty magma chamber** caving in
  - By **weakened structure**
- Calderas have **bigger diameters** than craters[^2]
- Usually **water fills the caldera**, creating a lake
[^2]: In the context of volcanoes, the crater is where the magma comes out

## `Parts of the volcano`
- crater
- Throat
- Conduit
- Bedrock
- Magma chamber

## `Where do volcanoes form?`
- `Divergent boundaries`
  - Magma from **astenosphere**
  - **linear volcanoes**
  - Basalt lava is very fluid, spreads out on dry land
  - Basalt lava is very hot (1100-1200 °C)
- Rich in metals, less SiO<sub>2</sub>
- `Convergent Boundaries`
  - Stratovolcanoes
  - Viscous magma
  - Magma is cooler
  - More SiO<sub>2</sub>, less metallic
  - Lighter coloured rocks
- `Hot spot volcanoes`
  - No plate boundaries
  - Occurs at **mantle plumes**[^3]
  - mantle plumes melt the crust --> Volcano is created
  - Plate above mantle plume moves --> Volcano becomes **inactive**
[^3]: Mantle plumes (Köpenycsóvák) are spots of hot material moving up from the mantle

## `Post volcanic activity`
- Around volcanic areas
- Caused by **heat, water, chemicals**

### `Examples:`
- `Fumaroles:`
  - Steam eruption
  - Various solutes[^4]
  - $200-900°C$
- `Solfatara`:
  - Sulfuric vapor
  - $200-400°C$
[^4]: Oldott anyagok
- `Mofetta:`
  - CO<sub>2</sub> vapor
  - $>100°C$
- `Geysers:`
  - **Periodic** eruption
  - Hot water
