# Volcanoes
## `What are volcanoes?`
- **Circular / linear opening** in the earth
- Also a landform, often a mountain
    - Built from **multiple eruptions**
- Eruptions can be **explosive, effusive or both**


## `Shield volcanoes`
- **Effusive** eruptions
- **Broad**, Gently sloping
    - **Fluid** lava spreads out over a larger area
- E.g: Mauna Loa, Hawaii
## `Stratovolcanoes`
- **Explosive and effusive**
- **Viscous** lava and pyroclasts[^1]
- **Steep**, often symmetrical
- E.g: Mount St. Helens
[^1]: fragments ejected during explosive eruption


### Questions for Mount St. Helens eruption:
1. What mountain range is Mount St. Helens a part of? :: `Cascades`
2. What started the eruption? :: `Pressure buildup / Earthquake`
3. What kind of eruption happened? :: `Lateral`
4. What is lahar? :: `Slurry of meltwater mixing with rock and debris`
5. What is in the cloud above the volcano? :: `Ash/Rocks/Steam`

## `Caldera`
- Forms from volcanoes:
  - Via **explosive eruption**
  - **Empty magma chamber** caving in
  - By **weakened structure**
- Calderas have **bigger diameters** than craters[^2]
- Usually **water fills the caldera**, creating a lake
[^2]: In the context of volcanoes, the crater is where the magma comes out

## `Parts of the volcano`
- crater
- Throat
- Conduit
- Bedrock
- Magma chamber
## `Where do volcanoes form?`
- Around Convergent plate boundaries
- Also divergent boundaries
  - Magma coming directly from the astenosphere
  - These create linear volcanoes
