# <span style="color:#fabd2f">Resources of the lithosphere

- `Two large groups`
  - Raw materials
  - Energy sources


## `Raw materials`
- Things used to create products
- **Ores**[^1] belong here
- Formation of ores:
    - Magma comes close to the surface
    - Different metals separate out of the magma (because of thermal gradients)
    - at $1000°C:$ Fe, Ni, V, Pt
    - at $500°C:$ U, Th, Sn

- `Other useful rocks:`
  - `Sand:`
    - glass-making
    - construction
    - printed circuits
  - `Clay:`
    - Pottery
    - Construction (roofing)
    - Kaolin --> used to make china[^2]
  - `Limestone:`
    - Construction (making cement)
  - `Andesite, basalt:` 
    - Railroad construction, road-making
  - `Marble, granite:`
    - Ornamental stone
  - `Salts:`
    - Rock salts: Cooking, chemical industry
    - Potassium salts: Fertilizers
  - `Gemstones:`
    - Jewelry

## <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Non-renewable energy sources
- 3 types:
### <span style="color:#fabd2f">Petroleum & natural gas
- Similar properties as minerals/rocks --> Technically categorized as rocks
- Formed from _zooplankton_[^3]
- `Formation process:`
  - Zooplankton go extinct
  - Their biomass sinks to the ocean floor
  - Biomass becomes buried by sediment --> No oxygen access + pressure
  - Lack of oxygen prevented decomposition
  - Over time, the biomass slowly transforms into *hydrocarbons*
### <span style="color:#fabd2f"> Coal
- Similar formation process to [Petroleum & natural gas](#petroleum--natural-gas)
- Formed in _carboniferous period_ --> very dense vegetation
- Formation process is called `coalification`
- Formation:
  1. Peat
  2. Lignite
  3. Brown coal
  4. Black coal
  5. Anthracite
- During formation process, the coal gets _darker_, _harder_, gets a better _heat value_
[^3]: Term for every microscopic marine *animal*
