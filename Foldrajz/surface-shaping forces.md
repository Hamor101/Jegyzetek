# Surface shaping external forces

## External forces

- Weather elements, wind, rain, snow
- Water
  - Rivers, seas
  - ice - glaciers

## External vs internal forces

|x|Internal|External|
|-----|-----|-----|
|Driving force|Internal heat of the Earth|Solar radiation|
|Rate of process|Relatively fast|Relatively slow|
|Result|Creates uneven surfaces|Creates smooth/even surfaces|



## Weathering[^1]
- Weathering is the breaking down and wearing away of rocks due to Earth's external forces
- `2 types:`
  - Physical
  - Chemical
  - Biological -- The roots of plants break apart rocks
[^1]: Legjobb magyar fordítás: Kőzetmegbontás


### `Physical weathering -- Aprózódás`
- Not only mechanical changes
- Only the particle size of the rock changes
- The chemical composition reamins the same
- `Causes:`
    1. Temperature fluctuations
        - Expansion and shrinking of particles due to temperature changes
        - Typical in deserts, arctic areas, high mountains
    2. Freeze-Thaw action
        - Water seeps into cracks in rocks
        - Water freezes
        - Water expands when frozen (by 9%) --> cracks get bigger

### `Chemical weathering -- Málás`
- Chemical reactions change the internal structure of rocks
- Slowly destroys rocks
- Most typical chemical weathering in nature:
  - Limestone being destroyed by rain
  - Limestone --> CaCO<sub>3</sub>
  - Rainwater has a pH of 5.5 --> it's slightly acidic[^2]
  - Because of this, limestone dissolves in rainwater
- Creates **kartsic forms:**
  - sinkholes, dolinas, caves
- Flora can also cause chemical weatering:
  - Roots can create weak acids
  - Lichen can also create acids
- E.g Oxidation
[^2]: CO<sub>2</sub> gets into rainwater, becomes H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (carbonic acid)


### `Factors effecting the rate of weathering`
- Type of rock --> sedimentary > igneous/metamorphic
- Temperature --> high > low
- Total annual precipitation --> high > low
#
- Deep, fast weathering happens around equatorial belt / monsoon zone
