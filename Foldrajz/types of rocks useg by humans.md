# Resources of the lithosphere

- `Two large groups`
  - Raw materials
  - Energy sources


## `Raw materials`
- Things used to create products
- **Ores**[^1] belong here
- Formation of ores:
    - Magma comes close to the surface
    - Different metals separate out of the magma (because of thermal gradients)
    - at $1000°C:$ Fe, Ni, V, Pt
    - at $500°C:$ U, Th, Sn
    - 

[^1]: Minerals or rocks from which the needed metal can be extracted easily and cheaply enough


## `Energy sources`
