He was also considered a god and was believed to possess the secrets of heaven and earth. They were despotic rulers. The pharaoh was responsible for all aspects of life in Egypt. These included keeping the public works in order, directing the army, keeping peace, and making laws. He also controlled trade and the economy. Egyptian peasants paid most of their taxes in grain, which was stored in the royal warehouses. If a famine occurred, feeding the people became the responsibility of the pharaoh.
Taxes and payments from other countries were used to maintain public buildings, irrigation works and ports. The pharaoh owned Egypt's mines and quarries and the trading fleets that sailed to foreign lands."</p>**

|Egypt | Cuneiform | Clay | syllables
| Mesopotamia | Hieroglyphic | Papyrus | Pictures and consonants |

**<p style="font-family: 'Garamond'">Cuneiform hard to learn. To master it children usually went to a temple school. Using a clay tablet as a textbook, the teacher wrote on the left-hand side, and the pupil copied the model on the right. Any mistaked could be smoothed out. The pupil began by making individual wedges in various positions and then went on to groups of wedges. Thousands of groups had to be learned. Finally the pupil was assigned a book to copy, but the work was slow and laborious. Many first chapters of all the important Sumerian works have been handed down from students' tablets, but only fragments of the rest of the books survive**</p>
