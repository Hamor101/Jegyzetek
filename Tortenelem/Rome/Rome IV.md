# Rome IV

## Negative consequences of Rome becoming an empire

### Economic
- Soldiers came home from war to find their lands in ruin
  - They didn't have the money to fix their lands --> They had to sell their lands
  - Without lands they couldn't serve in the military --> they couldn't make money
  - They had to sell their votes in order to make a living
- This led to impoverisment and creation of the **proletariat**[^1]
[^1]: From latin word for children. Representing that they had so little the only thing they could have was children.

### Military
- Lack of soldiers 
  - To solve this, reform was needed
  - Land requirement for service was abolished
  - Professional soldiers were introduced (meaning they were paid)
    - Mercenaries
  - Veterans got land
  - They were also provided with equipment
- Powerful neighbors



### Political
- Rome was too big
- This led to inefficient government
- Republican structure begame obsolete (only 1 year terms meant that representatives couldn't familiarise themselves with the issues of the empire)
- Too much land area, not enough consuls --> Consuls had to deal with a lot of isssues

### Political groups
- Proletariat
- Knights
  - Not military
  - "Businessmen"
  - Had wealth, but **no political power**
- Senators <--> People's party
  - Senate didn't recognize problems
  - People's party wanted to change
- Senators were liked by:
  - Nobles (patricians, rich plebeians)
- People's party was liked by:
  - Knights
  - Proletariat
