# Ancient Rome

## Effects of geography on Rome's history
- farming was important
- `South`: Growing citrus, olives, grapes
- `North`: Growing wheat
- Situated in the middle of the mediterranean: easy trade, easy  colonisation/conquest
- Not fragmented --> unity was possible

## Roman Society
- Two basic social groups:
    1. `Patricians`
    2. `Plebeians`

### `Patricians`
 - Monopoly on authority positions --> They controlled the state
 - All priests were chosen from among them
 - All civil and criminal **law was in their hands**
 - Laws were not written down, they could be interpreted
 - If the married someone from the other class, the children belonged to that class
 - They were **large landowners**
 - They **dominated the army** since a soldier had to provide his own equipment


### `Plebeians`
 - In the assembly they were **outvoted by the other class** and its clients
 - They **didn't participate in the administration** of the state religion.
 - They had neither the knowledge of the laws nor could they become judges
 - Some were plagued by the harsh law of debt
 - They didn't have the right to hold public office
 - Many were poor as they had little land, though some grew wealthy through trade and industrial activity
 - They receivede no share in the distribution of public lands
 - They srved in the army as infantry but had to leave their lands unattended in the meanwhile\
